Semiautomatic Determination of Arterial Input Function in DCE-MRI of the Abdomen
Harrison Kim, Desiree E Morgan
The goal of this study was to develop a semiautomatic segmentation technique of the abdominal aorta to determine the arterial input function (AIF). &nbsp;A total of 24 patients having therapy naïve abdominal cancers were imaged using DCE-MRI on a 3T MR scanner. &nbsp;DCE-MRI continued for 4.2 minutes with 2.1 seconds temporal resolution (120 acquisitions). &nbsp;Gadoteridol (0.1 mmol/kg) was infused intravenously at 30 seconds after starting DCE-MRI, and flushed with 20-ml saline (2 ml/s). &nbsp;Patients were instructed to hold breath after maximal inhalation, and repeat as needed to full inspiration. &nbsp;The location of the abdominal aorta was manually identified, but its segmentation and motion tracking were automatically implemented. &nbsp;AIFs determined in the aortic region with and without tracking motion were statistically compared. &nbsp;The aortic region was further segmented into multiple smaller regions, and the AIF change according to the size of the region of interest (ROI) was examined. &nbsp;The displacement of the abdominal aorta during DCE-MRI was 3.4±2.3 (mean±SD) mm. &nbsp;The root mean square error (RMSE) of AIF from the best fitting curve was 0.110±0.010 mM after motion correction, which was significantly smaller than that before motion correction (0.134±0.016 mM; p&lt;0.001). &nbsp;The amplitude of AIF varied up to 15% according to the ROI size. &nbsp;However, when the radius of ROI was reduced more than 3 mm, the variation in AIF amplitude was less than 5%. &nbsp;Therefore the ROI having smaller radius than that of aorta will need to be used to determine a reliable AIF in abdominal DCE-MRI.
