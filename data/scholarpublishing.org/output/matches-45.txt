Magnetic Resonance T2 Relaxometry in Knee Joint Patellar Cartilage Imaging
Raj Kumar Soundarajan, Rajeswaran R, Sheila Elangovan
<p><strong>Background:</strong>Over the past decade the diagnosis of knee disorders has improved significantly through better imaging techniques. Imaging of the Knee joint includes Radiograph, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Arthrography and of advanced imaging techniques like T2 Relaxometry.</p><p></p><p><strong>Aim:</strong>To obtain T2 relaxometry value of knee joint patellar cartilages &amp; to compare the T2 relaxometry values of the Osteoarthritic patients with that of the other cause.</p><p><strong>Material &amp; Methods:</strong>20 patients who presented themselves in Radiology department of either sex whose reports and image datas are collected prospectively during the study period of December 2011 to February 2012. All the patients data within the study period were collected. Patients were selected irrespective of their age group, gender and pathologic findings, a detailed history with various patients data includes patient demography, age, sex and the study reports are collected and is entered in a specially designed Profoma. The acquired study data of Sagittal T2 Mapping High Resolution sequence of each patient are then post processed by using a GE Advantage Workstation (version 4.4) and T2 Relaxometry values of various knee joint cartilages (Medial Patellar cartilage, Lateral Patellar cartilage) are collected by using a special software and is entered in the Profoma table.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>Conventional MRI may not show early cartilage changes; Cartilage edema following trauma (or) Due to osteoarthritis can be picked up early by T2 Mapping. hence it is useful in early patient management.</p>
