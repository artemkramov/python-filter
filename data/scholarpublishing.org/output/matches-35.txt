Pattern Matching Image Retrieval Technique for Medical Image Database
Vikash Yadav, Vandana Dixit Kaushik
<p>In current scenario Medical Imaging is becoming very popular due to it’s widely use Medical Profession. Now it&nbsp;became very easy to fetch some useful information from a large data repository using some data mining techniques.&nbsp;In Medical Imaging doctor’s can easily identify the disease when they already have a warehouse of similar kind of&nbsp;disease. Retrieval can be done by two ways one is Text based and another is Content based. Here it is suggested how&nbsp;the image query is processed, how similarity based retrieval is perform over images and how the image database is&nbsp;organized. In this paper, an image retrieval method is proposed which can be used for medical images. The query is&nbsp;in the form of an image from that query image we construct a graph using canny edge detection and patch based&nbsp;feature extraction method then that graph is compared with the existing ones. In this way if matching occur then the&nbsp;query image is similar to the required one otherwise there were no similar image exist in the database.</p>
