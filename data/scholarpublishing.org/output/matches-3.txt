Application of a Computer-aid Diagnosis of Pneumoconiosis for CR X-ray Images
Koji Abe, Masahide Minami, Ryosuke Miyazaki, Haiyan Tian
This paper presents a method for applying a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for pneumoconiosis to chest X-ray images digitalized by the computed radiography (CR) system.When we reported the CAD before, we showed performance of the CAD for chest X-ray images digitalized by a CCD scanner. However, since density distribution of the CR X-ray images is quite different from the images digitalized by CCD scanner, it is necessary to equip some preprocessing into the CAD for applying to the CR images. In this paper, as the first trial for the application, drawing rib edges and additional lines on the CR images by a tablet PC, we examined whether the CAD can be interactively applied to the CR images. Using 51 chest CR X-ray images, we compared the proposed CAD system with the existing system for the images digitalized by CCD scanner.
