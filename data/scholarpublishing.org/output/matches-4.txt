Wavelet-based Image Fusion for Enhancement of ROI in CT Image
Nguyen Thanh Hai
This paper proposes a novel method for enhancing Computed Tomography (CT) image. In this proposed method, the entropy-based histogram algorithm was applied to detach significant values in CT image to produce a detached image. In addition, wavelet transforms were employed for both the original CT image and the detached image to create image fusion. Therefore, an enhanced image with tumor region was obtained for diagnosis using an inverse wavelet transform. The result is that the processed region in the enhanced image shows more prominent points than that in the original image. This result can allow physicians or doctors diagnose and predict more accurately tumor regions in the enhanced CT image
