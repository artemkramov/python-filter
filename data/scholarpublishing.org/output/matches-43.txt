Advantages and Disadvantages of using Third-party software in the development of the CAS_Annotate and CAS_Navigate Medical Applications
João Fradinho Oliveira
<p>This paper address the main design decision issues taken when using third party libraries in the creation of two medical applications [1] that specifically require editing or creating geometry from CT images (CAS_Annotate) and interactive 3D visualization (CAS_Navigate). Whilst the purpose of the first application was to research different 3D reconstruction algorithms, the second application was created to research different visual metaphors and the reconstructions themselves. This paper weights aspects such as the learning curve time versus coding in-house time, robustness and possible customization. In theory both applications could have been developed within the same IGTSK [2] framework, but the available project time and the development of different phases of the project made that impossible, instead a&nbsp; black box approach of using IGSTK's 3D Msh format was crucial to import algorithm results tested with a simple GLUT application, thus allowing development to be made in parallel.</p>
