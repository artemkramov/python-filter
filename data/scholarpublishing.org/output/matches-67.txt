Robust Hashing Algorithm for Data Verification
Rushdi A. Hamamreh
<p>This paper &nbsp;presents a method for data authentication. Data authentication is the process of being able to verify the source of data. With data authentication, one can distinguish messages originating from the intended sender and an attacker. Data authenticity verification procedure uses cryptographic hash functions as the core algorithm. This algorithm based on linear combination of matrices to find non-invertible matrix, DILH takes advantage about of the compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix, we design a robust method by employing strong collision resistance and &nbsp;reduces the hashing time.</p>
