Design and Implementation of Wireless Body Area Network using physiological parameters
Savita Sindhu, Dr. Shruti Vashist
<p>Applications of e-Health deals with various physiological signals like body temperature, Blood Pressure, Electrocardiogram(ECG) captured by either wired networks or wireless sensor networks (WSN).ECG is one of the important parameter. A three lead based ECG acquisition system, body temperature; pulse rate monitoring system is presented in the paper below which can store data. The data can be sent wirelessly to the doctor for further analysis. The proposed design makes use of wearable sensors which will not be of discomfort to the patient. The patient can move around easily.</p>
