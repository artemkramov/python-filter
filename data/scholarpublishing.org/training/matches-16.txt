Disease modeling – An alert system for informing environmental risk factor for TB infection
K. Ram Mohan Rao, Yogesh Kant, Satya Chandra
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>and spreads through air by a person suffering from TB. A risk map is derived based on socio-economic, environmental, health facilities, and Biological characteristics for quantifying the infection risk of the locality. The inter relation between the environmental variables, meteorological parameters, and socio economic variables such as rainfall, temperature, family income and population density with respect to number of past cases have been studied using regression model. Risk is calculated by mean of the probability of occurrence of tuberculosis and vulnerability to the infection. The risk map is computed by using statistical techniques to form spatial maps. An alert system is developed by using GIS from the background of geospatial data and later published to the web using open source internet GIS technologies.
