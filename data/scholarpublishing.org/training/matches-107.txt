A Fuzzy Set Approach to Bacterial Wilt Recognition
Obi Jonathan Chukwuyeni, A.A Imianvan, D.M Okpor
<p>Bacterial wilt&nbsp;(<em>Ralstonia Solanacearum) is a bacterial which</em>attack most plant species in different plant families resulting in numerous financial implications to farmers. The predominant symptoms includes: yellowish leaves, permanent wilted leaves, permanent upright leaves, brownish vascular tissues, dark brownish cortex and thin thread of ooze infected structure. Bacterial wilt&nbsp;can be readily spread through the movement of contaminated soil and infected vegetative propagated plants, in contaminated irrigation water, and on the surfaces of tools (cutting knives) and equipment used to work with the plants, and on soiled clothing. It often attacks many floricultural and vegetable bedding plant crops. Some of the other known hosts of bacterial wilt&nbsp;include Pelargonium, tomato, peppers, eggplant, bean, and beet. Most of the approaches for bacterial wilt recognition are quite time consuming and subjective in nature. Therefore we proposed an objective approach, capable of initiating fuzzy rules with the aim of quick and objective recognition of bacterial wilt attack.</p>
