A New Edge Detection Method for CT-Scan Lung Images
Ali El-Zaart, Toufic El-Arwadi
<p>Lung cancer is one of the most serious health problems in the world. Lung Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is a potential method to accomplish a range of quantitative tasks such as early cancer and disease detection, analysis of disease progression. Edge detection in Lung image is a fundamental step in CAD system and many algorithms have suggested for edge detection in image, In this paper a new operator has developed for edge detection based on finite difference method. Experimentation showed that the proposed operator gave good results in detection the edges in Lung images.</p>
