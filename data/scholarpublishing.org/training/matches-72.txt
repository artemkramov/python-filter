Monitoring System of Mechanical Activity of the Heart and Goelocalization of the Patient Based on the Mqtt Cloud
Andre Rodrigue Tchamda, Robert Tchitnga, Francois P. Pelap, Martin Kom
<p>The queue of patients for consultation and appointments that we observe in our health centers is growing in size from day to day given the exponential growth of the human population. Medical systems based on telemonitoring have been developed to remotely monitor the health status of patients. In this work, we constructed a medical prototype for remote monitoring of the mechanical activity of the heart and for geolacalization of the patient based on Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). The prototype will be used by individuals or by health centers without a doctor. The geolacalization will enable us to locate the injured individual. The physiological data and GPS coordinates are collected using a portable kit and are transmitted directly to an MQTT cloud using a Wi-Fi hotspot. A web server hosted in the kit allows the user to enter the service set identifier (SSID) of the access point through a smartphone. MQTT cloud will take care of the storage, geolacalization and transmission of the signal from the mechanical activity of the heart to the doctors. Almost all smart terminals with a web browser can easily access data (smartphone, tablet, computer). Tests carried out on individuals reveal that the proposed prototype is reliable in sampling, real-time transmission and geolacalization in street map and imagery, which can help in diagnosis and rapid intervention.</p>
