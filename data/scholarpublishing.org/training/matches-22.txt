Improved Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm for Brain Tumor Identification Analysis Using Magnetic Resonance Brain Images
Isselmou Abd El kader, Shuai Zhang, Guizhi Xu
<p>Image processing plays a very important role in the analysis images of different standards; it supports the doctor’s decision and helps to easily diagnose the patient. In this paper we processed the magnetic resonance brain images, which is the most advanced medical images using the improved fuzzy c-means algorithm, this process consists of two stages, the first stage of tumor identification in the resonance brain images and the second stage analysis of the algorithm performance using accuracy detection, TC, DOI, sensitivity and specificity, the improved fuzzy c-means algorithm has given excellent results in the terms of efficiency and performance values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
