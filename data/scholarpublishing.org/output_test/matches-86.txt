Melanoma occurrence rates contain be increasing for the earlier 3 decades. The majority&nbsp;folks&nbsp;analyzed&nbsp;with non-melanoma&nbsp;carcinoma&nbsp;contain higher&nbsp;prospects&nbsp;to cure,&nbsp;however malignant melanoma&nbsp;endurance rates&nbsp;are&nbsp;low compare to&nbsp;different&nbsp;carcinoma&nbsp;varieties. It is important that one in 5 Americans will grow skin cancer in their life, and generally, one American expires from skin cancer each hour. A system to obviate this kind of skin cancer is being scheduled and is very in-demand. Initial detection of melanoma is one of the key factors to increment the chance of remedy significantly. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical and have aberrant borders with rages and notched edges, thus&nbsp;analyzing&nbsp;the form&nbsp;of the skin lesion is consequential for melanoma early detection and aversion. In this paper,&nbsp;we have a tendency to&nbsp;introduce&nbsp;an automatic&nbsp;skin lesion segmentation and analysis for premature detection and obviation predicated on color and shape geometry. The system additionally incorporates extra feature sets such as color to find the wound type. In our planned system, we use PH2 Dermoscopy image&nbsp;information. This image&nbsp;info&nbsp;contains&nbsp;a complete&nbsp;of&nbsp;fifty&nbsp;dermoscopy&nbsp;pictures&nbsp;of lesions,&nbsp;together with traditional, malignant melanoma&nbsp;and atypical cases. Our approach of analyzing&nbsp;the form&nbsp;pure mathematics&nbsp;and therefore the&nbsp;color&nbsp;are going to be subsidiary to detect atypical lesions afore it grows and becomes a melanoma case.</p>
