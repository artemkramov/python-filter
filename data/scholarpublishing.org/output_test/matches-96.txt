Image segmentation process is considered the most essential step in image analysis especially in the medical field. In this paper, the color segmentation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia images (ALL) is applied to segment each leukemia image into two clearly defined regions: blasts and background. The ALL segmentation process is based on two different color spaces: RGB color space and HSV color space. The comparison performance between the segmentation methods based on RGB and HSV color spaces are investigated to find the best method to segment the acute lymphoblastic leukemia images. The experimental results show that the segmentation of ALL images based on HSV color space yield better accuracy than RGB color space when compared with the manual segmentation image made by medical experts. Using HSV color space, the shape of blasts in ALL blood samples is closely preserved with segmentation accuracy over 99.00%. However, segmentation based HSV color space was chosen as it produced the highest ALL segmentation rate.</p>
