</p></div><p>The 2<sup>nd</sup>edition of the book «Spasticity: Diagnosis and Management» is edited by Dr. Allison Brashear who is an eminent expert and clinician in this field. It is written by a group of contributors (48 authors) with various expertise. I believe this book is a useful reference for professionals and trainees who take care of patients with spasticity. It can also be a useful tool for researchers and for clinical trials.</p><p
