</p></div><p><strong>Background:</strong>Diabetes mellitus the metabolic disorder, can interact with atherosclerosis in ischemic strokes to initiate, activate and propagate vascular events Patients with diabetes have a two- to threefold higher risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease. This increased risk is largely attributed to the clustering of other risk factors like, age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, poor glycaemic status.<br><strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong>To identify the independent predictors for severity and functional outcome of acute ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus.<br><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong>The study is a prospective, case-control, hospital based study done at Department of Neurology, Narayana Medical College for a period of 1½ year.<br><strong>Results:</strong>100 acute ischemic stroke patients were recruited in the study and the distribution of risk factors among them were studied. Age, smoking, alcohol, CV Doppler, TGL, HDL, FPG, PPG and HbA1c were found to have cumulative influence on the stroke severity (NIHSS) and functional outcome (mRS). Whereas alcohol and HbA1C found to have significant independent predictive value for stroke severity at admission.<br><strong>Conclusion:</strong>Alcohol and HbA1c at admission were found to have independent effect on the stroke severity. None of the risk factors studied were having independent impact on the stroke functional outcome at the follow up.</p><p
