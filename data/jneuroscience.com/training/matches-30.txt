</p></div><p>Discovery of genetic influence on craving by Blum, and Noble allowed more research on genetic determinants of mental and physical health. It led to DNA Customization of nutraceutical products in humans. One such product KB220Z has been shown to reduce cravings by influencing gene expression. This and other products have made neuro-nutrigenomics an important field of scientific investigation. It offers promise of improving human health and wellbeing. Further, development of the Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS™), which analyzes genetic profile to predict likelihood of developing chemical or behavioral addiction (Reward Deficiency Syndrome [RDS]) could potentially help in the identification of vulnerable individuals prior to the development of addictive behaviors. While customization of neuronutrients, is still at its infancy, there are only three such studies from our laboratory in the literature for RDS behaviors, it promises to have a significant role in near future. Our research suggests that Gene Guided Precision Nutrition™ with specific polymorphic targeting may induce personalized treatment and or even relapse for RDS that includes both chemical and behavioral addiction.</p><p
