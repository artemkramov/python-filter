</p></div><p>Chronic pelvic pain is a common medical condition affecting up to 16 percent of reproductive-aged women. There are many possible etiologies of chronic pelvic pain ranging from gynecologic to non-gynecologic. Treatment is based on the theorized cause but often refractory to traditional medical and surgical intervention. In over one third of the cases, the cause of chronic pelvic pain is unknown, even after an extensive workup including invasive surgical procedures. Women with chronic pelvic pain often have overlapping psychiatric diagnoses and history of physical or sexual abuse. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended in order to address the patients’ medical, psychological, and social needs.</p><p
