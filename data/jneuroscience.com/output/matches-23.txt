</p></div><p>Chronic pelvic pain (CPP), particularly pelvic pain among women, remains one of the most controversial and the least understood conditions that practicing gynecologists encounter on a daily basis. It is estimated that this condition affects up to a quarter of all women [1]. The purpose of this article is to describe current surgical management strategies and the success rates of the surgical interventions, in order to help physicians counsel their patients and choose the best surgical option.<br>Chronic pelvic pain is defined as pain symptoms of at least six months duration that cause functional disability. All pain can be broadly divided into somatic and visceral. These two groups can be further subdivided into nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic, psychogenic, mixed, and idiopathic pain [2]. It is of the utmost importance to understand that only nociceptive pelvic pain is potentially amenable to surgical treatment.</p><p
