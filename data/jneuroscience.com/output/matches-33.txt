</p></div><p><strong>Objective:</strong>The present study aimed to determine the frequency of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) gene 196 A/G polymorphism in Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients in northern Turkey.</p><p><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong>184 probable AD patients (according to NINCDS and ADRDA criteria) and 133 healthy controls were included to this study. The genotyping of BDNF gene rs6265 polymorphism were evaluated in the laboratories of our University Medical Faculty Medical Biology department, in the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system using by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong>In all, 54 (29.35%) patients had mild dementia, 72 (39.13%) had moderate dementia, and 58 (31.52%) had advanced-stage dementia. Mean duration of AD was 4.33 years. There was not a significant difference if the frequency of BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism between the patient and control groups. The patient group included 88 (47.83%) males and 96 (52.17%) females, versus 72 (54.14%) males and 61 (45.86%) females in the control group. Moreover, there was not a significant association between the frequency of BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism and gender distribution in the patient group. Mean age in the patient group was 75.83 years, versus 74.29 years in the control group; however, there were not any significant changes when correlating BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism with age. Similarly, there was not a significant association between BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism and AD stage in the patient group.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>In conclusion, there was not an association between AD and BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism in the northern Turkish population.</p><p
