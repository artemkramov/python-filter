</p></div><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is typically characterized by resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia with onset after 50 years of age. However sometimes, especially Juvenile Parkinsonism, may present with atypical features which make the diagnosis difficult and intriguing. Juvenile Parkinsonism i.e. onset of PD before 20 years of age, can present predominantly with dystonia and pain only without being associated with resting tremor. Here we report a case of Juvenile Parkinsonism in which diagnosis could be made only after several years of follow up and multiple consultations because of atypical features, and hence the diagnostic dilemma faced.</p><p
