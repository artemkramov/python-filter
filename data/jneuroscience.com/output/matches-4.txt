</p></div><p><strong>Objective:</strong>We report a single case of resolution of chronic incapacitating headache following surgical fenestration of a large pineal cyst.<br><strong>Background:</strong>There is an established link between pineal cysts and headaches particularly in the presence of ventriculomegaly and gaze paresis. Our patient’s chronic headache was attributed to a large pineal cyst.<br><strong>Result:</strong>Following surgical fenestration there was immediate, complete relief of the patient’s unremitting headache. Ten months since the operation the patient remains headache free.<br><strong>Conclusion:</strong>This case demonstrates that surgical intervention may play a role in management of patients who have large benign pineal cysts and intractable headache despite the absence of ventriculomegaly and gaze paresis.</p><p
