</p></div><p>The transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methodology for mapping the primary motor cortex (M1) for laryngeal muscles and Broca’s area was recently established on group of healthy subjects. Here we present the first patient with tumor in the frontal cortex of the left hemisphere that underwent mapping of M1 and Broca’s area as a part of preoperative neurosurgical planning. The TMS findings greatly facilitated awake brain surgery of these crucial motor speech cortical areas. Future studies are needed on group of patients undergoing TMS mappings of the (M1) for laryngeal muscles and Broca’s area with intraoperative testing with electrical cortical stimulation.</p><p
