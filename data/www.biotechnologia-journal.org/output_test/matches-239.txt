Śliwiak, Joanna et al. "Hyp-1 protein from St John’s wort as a PR-10 protein." BioTechnologia, vol. 94, no. 1, 2014, pp. 47-50. doi:10.5114/bta.2013.46437
PR-10 proteins form a large subclass of plant pathogenesis-related proteins that are expressed in response to harmful<br><br>environmental factors in a wide range of species. Although their function is still not clear, structural data suggest<br><br>that their characteristic internal hydrophobic cavity can bind relevant plant small-molecule mediators. Hyp-1 from<br><br>St John's wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>), initially proposed as a catalyst for the biosynthesis of hypericin, was<br><br>eventually shown to share sequence similarity and a folding pattern with PR-10 proteins. The crystal structure of<br><br>Hyp-1 in complex with fluorescent probe ANS reveals three distinct and separated binding sites that are unique<br><br>among PR-10 proteins. The structure can provide guidance in our quest for the true physiological ligands of Hyp-1.</div
