The present invention relates to a Lyme disease vaccine, a genetic construct, recombinant protein, method for genetic construct design, method for vaccine delivery, method for recombinant proteins delivery, use of recombinant proteins in the production of Lyme disease vaccine. In particular, the method concerns the use of TROSPA and TROSPA- Salpl 5 recombinant proteins derived from castor bean tick (<i>Ixodes riccinus</i>) as a component of Lyme disease vaccine for animals. The antibodies present in blood of an immunized vertebrate directed against the TROSPA proteins considerably reduce the chance of infecting new ticks by blocking or hindering the interaction of TROSPA protein with OspA protein of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The interaction is crucial in the process of the spirochete entering a tick. The antibodies directed against the TROSPA- Salpl5 protein protect vertebrates from infection on the stage of Borellia diffusion by destroying their protective coating formed at the surface as a result of the interaction between the Salpl5 tick protein and OspC spirochete protein. The vaccine based on TROSPA tick proteins and TROSPA-Salpl5 proteins may be used independently or together with the OspA recombinant proteins and OspC protein of<i>Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato.</i></div
