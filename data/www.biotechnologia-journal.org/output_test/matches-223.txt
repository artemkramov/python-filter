Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) plays an essential role in the generation of a highly competent repertoire<br><br>of antibodies by participating in class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). After<br><br>B cell stimulation by antigens, AID initiates SHM and CSR by deamination of cytidine to uridine in the variable<br><br>and constant regions of Ig genes. An adverse effect of AID’s ability to directly modify genome sequences is its<br><br>mutagenic potential. AID has been shown to occasionally target non-Ig genes and its abnormal expression is<br><br>strongly associated with tumorigenesis. Aberrant AID expression can also be triggered by some oncogenic pathogens,<br><br>such as<i>Helicobacter pylori</i>and several viruses. The latest reports show that also under physiological conditions<br><br>AID might act beyond the immune system. Data exist suggesting that AID can play a role in the process<br><br>of active genome demethylation – the heart of epigenetic gene activation and reprogramming. Moreover, it has<br><br>been shown that abnormal genome demethylation mediated by AID might be associated with human colon cancers.<br><br>The potential role of AID in the active demethylation process is still controversial, but the hypothesis that<br><br>aberrant AID expression may cause cancerogenesis by changing genome methylation patterns appears highly<br><br>attractive. As a unique human enzyme able to induce both genetic and epigenetic alterations under physiological<br><br>and pathological conditions, AID could be a promising and versatile drug target. In this review we present the<br><br>current state of knowledge on this topic and the controversies surrounding the pleiotropic effect of AID function.</div
