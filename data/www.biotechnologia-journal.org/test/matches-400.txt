/div><div>The iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) are two cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins involved in the mechanisms<br><br>that control iron metabolism in mammalian cells. They modulate the expression of iron-related proteins<br><br>at a post-transcriptional level by binding to specific iron regulatory elements (IREs) on their mRNAs. IRP-IRE<br><br>interaction can block protein synthesis or stabilize the mRNA. At low intracellular iron concentration, IRPs bind<br><br>to the IRE of ferritin or ferroportin mRNAs and block their translation. Direct interactions between IRPs and<br><br>several IRE motifs stabilize transferrin receptor mRNA. The converse regulation of ferritin and TfR synthesis,<br><br>being a consequence of the lack of binding of IRPs to IRE, occurs in cells with high iron level. Thus, IRP-mediated<br><br>regulation rapidly restores the physiological level of iron during its deficiency as well as excess. The role of IRPs<br><br>in maintaining the intracelluar iron balance has been relatively well characterized in numerous types of mammalian<br><br>cells. However, the importance of IRPs in the regulation of systemic iron metabolism in mammals, particularly,<br><br>in signaling between the cells which play major roles in body iron metabolism, such as duodenal enterocytes,<br><br>reticuloendothelial macrophages, hepatocytes, and bone marrow precursors of red blood cells, is only beginning<br><br>to be investigated. Several studies have shown that IRP2 is a predominant regulator of iron homeostasis in<br><br>mice housed under standard conditions, thus limiting the impact of IRP1 on this metabolic pathway. Although<br><br>IRP1-deficient mice do not display a strong pathological phenotype, a deletion of both IRPs is embryonic lethal.<br><br>In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which<br><br>are produced during inflammation, are potent IRP1 regulators that mediate the disassembly of Fe-S cluster of<br><br>IRP1. There is also an increasing evidence that NO and superoxide anion (O2) may induce a strong down-regulation<br><br>of IRP1 at the protein level and thus have an impact on the binding of IRP1 to IREs. All these data suggest<br><br>a predominant role of IRP1 in the regulation of iron homeostasis under specific physiopathological conditions.<
