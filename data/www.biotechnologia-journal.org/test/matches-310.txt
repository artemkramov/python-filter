/div><div>On the basis of observations in Europe and North America, this review will focus on Assisted Reproductive<br><br>Technologies (ART) and their impact on pregnancy outcomes; in particular multiple births, prematurity, and their<br><br>impact on birth defects. In Europe, since 1985 this experience has been somewhat different from that in North<br><br>America due not only to the differing populations, cultures, religious perspectives, but also to the rapid implementation<br><br>of medical technologies, relative freedom from governmental regulation, as well as the different forms of<br><br>payment for medical care that exist between the two continents. This review will focus on the impact of ART on<br><br>the complications of pregnancy, multiple gestations and prematurity, and will evaluate the required process and<br><br>content of informed consent surrounding ART from the legal perspective. Issues related to complications resulting<br><br>from the use of ART from the perspective of neonatal care providers will be highlighted as well as its impact<br><br>on the health care system in both regions. Given the impact of ART on both sides of the Atlantic, we propose that<br><br>governments, as well as professional organizations – including reproductive specialists, neonatologists, and health<br><br>economists – recommend that a legal limitation on the number of embryo transfers be imposed and that embryo<br><br>transfer restrictions be coupled with reimbursement for ART services. We suggest that reproductive rights should<br><br>not be infringed but that greater concern for and monitoring of the safety of both mothers and their newborns<br><br>be undertaken by various professional organizations and governments in Europe and North America. We also propose<br><br>systematic centralized reporting of the effectiveness of each form of ART, along with any associated complications,<br><br>and that ART babies be carefully monitored for birth defects and imprinting disorders on both continents.<
