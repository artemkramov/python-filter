/div><div>The key factor in production of fuel ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation is the efficient conversion<br><br>of granular starch into ethanol. Most difficult stage in the process is the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch<br><br>granules. Their supramolecular structure as well as crystallinity and presence of complexing agents are key factors<br><br>for the hydrolysis process. The aim of the study was to examine structural changes in starch granules during<br><br>the simultaneous processes of saccharification and fermentation of corn flour in the long-term repeated Simultaneous<br><br>Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) process with complete recycling of the stillage liquid fraction. The<br><br>SSF experiments were performed using corn flour as a raw material, the STARGEN 001 preparation as a hydrolytic<br><br>enzyme, and Red Star Ethanol Red (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) fermentation yeasts. Residual starch structure<br><br>after the 4th, and the 7th operation cycle was examined using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry,<br><br>IR spectroscopy as well as gel permeation chromatography. In spite of accumulating glycerol, organic acids<br><br>and inorganic ions in the fermentation broth, the repeated batch SSF process, with stillage recycling into the fermentation<br><br>phase conducted on corn flour with the use of the STARGEN 001 enzyme preparation, was found to<br><br>run efficiently. The amount of unhydrolyzed residual starch was independent of the number of operation cycles.<br><br>Hydrolysis of starch resulted in the formation of porous granules and a small amount of undigested granules and<br><br>pyramid-shaped residuals. Crystalline and amorphous regions were evenly digested. The molecular mass distribution<br><br>of residual starch after the SSF process significantly differed from that of native starch both in the region<br><br>corresponding to amylopectin and to amylose, while the most distinctive changes with respect to the amylopectin/<br><br>amylose ratio, i.e. in the 4th cycle the amylopectin content decreased by up to 19%.<
