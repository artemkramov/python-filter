/div><div>The development and improvement of an<i>in vitro</i>androgenesis of oilseed rape has allowed to obtain doubled haploid (DH) populations on a large scale. It has become possible to use DH lines in a genetic analysis of quantitative traits. Among the other benefits of DHs, homozygous state allowed to use them in a series of experiments aiming at the efficient selection of desired genotypes and their examination for adaptation in various environments. This is a review of our earlier studies which have confirmed numerous possibilities of using winter oilseed rape DH lines in a statistical analysis. Populations of DHs were used for: estimation of genetic parameters, transgression effects as well as a general and specific combining ability, genetic variation in DH populations or effects of the cross direction. In this paper, possibilities of a comprehensive multidirectional assessment of DHs lines of oilseed rape through the application of uni- and multivariate methods of quantitative genetics and mathematical methods are also presented.<
