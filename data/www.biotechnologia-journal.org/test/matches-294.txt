/div><div>Diseases caused by fungi from the genus<i>Fusarium</i>constitute a serious problem in spring wheat cultivation. Ear<br><br>infestation leads reduced yield and plant contamination with mycotoxins. Therefore it is essential to introduce<br><br>resistance genes to high-yielding cultivars. The generation of double haploid (DH) lines makes it possible to<br><br>shorten the time required to select favourable genotypes. The aim of this study was to analyze the capacity of<br><br>plants to regenerate in anther cultures and to generate DH of spring wheat genotypes that potentially constitute<br><br>germplasm material for resistance breeding, directed against fungi from the genus<i>Fusarium</i>. The plant material<br><br>comprised wheat cultivars with increased resistance to<i>Fusarium</i>: Sumai 3, Ning 8331, Norin 52, Frontana, as<br><br>well as line 8475-59 and high-yielding Polish cultivars: Łagwa, Waluta and Zadra. Spikes were subjected to<br><br>a thermal shock at 4EC. Anthers were placed on the C17 inducing medium. Two combinations of growth regulators,<br><br>i.e. 2,4-D and kinetin as well as 2,4-D and dicamba were applied. A total of 19,200 anthers were used, resulting<br><br>in a total of 440 calli from which 352 plants were obtained. Of this number 14% were albino. The regeneration<br><br>efficiency ranged from 0% to 17.33% depending on the analyzed genotype and the combination of growth regulators<br><br>in the induction medium. The highest number of green plants and seeds were obtained from cv. Łagwa, Zadra<br><br>and Sumai 3. Analyses of the regenerants, using a flow cytometer, demonstrated that depending on the genotype,<br><br>haploids constituted approx 75% of green plants. Doubling of the number of chromosomes at a 40% efficiency rate<br><br>took place when 0.1% colchicine was used. In the experiment 54 DH lines were obtained from which 283 kernels<br><br>were collected. The best genotypes for crossing components in terms of their regeneration ability were found<br><br>to be cultivar Frontana among the cultivars resistant to<i>Fusarium</i>, and cultivar Łagwa from Polish cultivars used<br><br>in the experiment.<
