The subject matter of this invention includes a sequence of double-stranded RNA: ATN-RNA, intervention using interference RNA intervention (iRNAi); the use of a sequence of double-stranded RNA: ATN-RNA, a method of treating (a) brain tumor and a method of inhibiting brain tumor cells which express tenascin, a kit for inhibiting cancer cell which expresses tenascin and a method for a kit preparation in a brain tumor therapy. Malignant gliomas preferentially express a number of surface markers that may be exploited as therapeutic targets, including tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein ubiquitously expressed by malignant gliomas, which probably contributes to the tumor cell adhesion, invasion, migration, and proliferation. For tenascin-C inhibition, the iRNAi approach has been applied.</div
