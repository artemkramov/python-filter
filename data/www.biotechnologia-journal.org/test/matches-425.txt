/div><div>The micropropagation of valuable orchid species such as<i>Spathoglottis plicata</i>could help in their conservation and increase their propagation rate. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of micronutrients (CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, MnSO<sub>4</sub>and Fe-EDTA) on the growth of<i>S. plicata</i>plantlets. Plantlets of uniform height (1.5 cm) were transferred to a half-strength MS media supplemented with vitamin B5 and different concentrations of selected micronutrients (copper, zinc, manganese and iron). The highest production of soluble protein content (38.98 mg/g of fresh weight, FW) was recorded when plantlets were treated with 25 μM MnSO<sub>4</sub>.<i>Spathoglottis plicata</i>plantlets formed the highest amount of chlorophyll (22.32 mg/g FW) when the growth media were supplemented with 75 μM Fe-EDTA. A total of 25 μM Fe-EDTA induced the production of up to 19.78 mg/g FW of carbohydrates in<i>S. plicata</i>plantlets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different concentrations of micronutrients had different effects on the activities of several enzymes, such as peroxidase, catalase, polyphenol oxidase and nitrate reductase.<
