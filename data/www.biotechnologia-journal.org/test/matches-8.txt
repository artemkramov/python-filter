/div><div>Chitinase and β-1,3 glucanase are enzymes that play important roles in the biocontrol of fungal plant pathogens. The effects of environmental conditions and culture medium composition on simultaneous chitinase and β-1,3 glucanase production from Streptomyces philanthi RM-1-138 were investigated using a conventional (one-factorat- a-time) method and a response surface methodology (RSM), respectively. The optimum cultivation conditions were at pH 7.5 and a temperature of 30EC. The optimized medium (4.88 g @ l!1 chitin, 6.27 g @ l!1 glucose, and 17.05 g @ l!1 malt extract) exhibited 53- and 80-fold increase in the activity of chitinase (0.53 U @ ml!1) and β-1,3 glucanase (8.79 U @ ml!1), respectively, compared to the original medium. The culture filtrate from the original and the optimized medium were partially purified and tested (by agar-well diffusion assay) for their antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani PTRRC-9 compared to the chemical fungicides carbendazim® and propiconazole ® (100 μg @ ml!1). The partially purified enzymes from the optimized medium exhibited 4.0-fold stronger antifungal activities against R. solani PTRRC-9 compared to that from the original medium and equal to that of<br><br>the chemical fungicide propiconazole® but slightly lower than that of carbendazim®.<
