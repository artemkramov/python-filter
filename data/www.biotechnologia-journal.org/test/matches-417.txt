/div><div>Herb dodder (<i>Cuscuta</i>spp.) is one of the most important parasitic plants that can severely affect crop yields in the world. So far, interactions of this parasitic plant with hosts were not investigated adequately. Here, we conducted a differential expression analyzes and identified a number of genes that were differentially expressed in haustorium tissue compared with the stem of<i>Cuscuta campestris</i>growing on Alfalfa. We obtained 439 cDNA fragments from haustoria (parasite-host connection zone) and stems (25 cm away from connections zones) using the cDNA-AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) method with eight different primer combinations. Of 439 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) that were detected, 145 fragments were identified as differentially expressed genes. Five TDF sequences were similar to known functional genes involved in signal transduction, metabolism, respiration, and stress responses. Genes encoding DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, potential heme-binding protein, lysine-specific demethylase 5A were selected for qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR analyzes confirmed the results obtained using cDNA-AFLP. Our findings shed light on the elicitation of dodder defense responses in the connection zone to overcome plant defense reactions.<
