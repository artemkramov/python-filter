/div><div>The biotechnology sector in Poland is currently at its initial stage of development. Year by year, this field experiences an increase in research and development activity. Changes are being experienced not only at a country’s level but also at a regional level. The strategic documents of Wielkopolska Province increasingly focus on the necessity to develop innovation and biotechnology. This region has a high potential for biotechnology development; however, its influence on the economy is still negligible. The aim of this article was to show the current state of the biotechnology sector in Wielkopolska Province and to analyze its development during 2011-2013. The analysis covered scientific units and enterprises that conducted research and development activity (R&amp;D) in the field of biotechnology as well as employees in scientific units and enterprises in R&amp;D activity. The sector has also been described on the basis of internal expenditures incurred totally by all units. In Wielkopolska Province, the internal expenditures of scientific units for pursuing R&amp;D activity in the field of biotechnology totaled PLN 26 million. On the other hand, the internal expenditures of enterprises on the biotechnological activity equaled PLN 67 million. The review of selected strategic documents shows the importance of biotechnology and its potential for development in Wielkopolska Province.<
