/div><div>The second half of the twentieth century can be regarded as the era of reductionism in biology, when, driven by<br><br>revolutions in molecular biology and genomics, the dominant paradigm saw biology as the sum of its parts: the<br><br>genes and proteins that make up each organism. Most biologists, however, now recognize that an integrative<br><br>approach – an understanding of how these parts work together in a complex entity – is as important as a reductionist<br><br>one. The relatively new discipline of systems biology combines this philosophy with an integration of<br><br>experimental biology with computational biology. One of the most ambitious goals of systems biology is that of<br><br>modeling the entire human physiology. Human body can be broken down into a series of interlocking organs and<br><br>systems, with one of the most tractable to model being the heart. Simple mathematical models of cardiac ion<br><br>channel action have developed over half a century into complex simulations that are being used successfully in<br><br>drug discovery. Integrating models together, however, requires close international collaboration. Under Framework<br><br>Six, the European Commission funded a few collaborative projects in human systems biology including<br><br>ImmunoGrid, which set out, perhaps over-ambitiously, to model the immune system. Under Framework Seven,<br><br>over €200 M has been channeled into research projects and networks under the umbrella of the Virtual Physiological<br><br>Human. Projects funded under this initiative cover a large range of systems and disease states, with<br><br>the cardio-vascular system and cancer dominating the first tranche of fifteen. This initiative is poised to further<br><br>develop under the next framework programme (Horizon 2020), which will run for seven years from 2014.<
