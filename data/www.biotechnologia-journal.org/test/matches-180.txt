/div><div>Lead is a ubiquitous xenobiotic metal and because of its widespread industrial use is one of the most serious environmental<br><br>pollutants. Lead is highly toxic and exposure to even low doses can produce adverse effects on all<br><br>living organisms. In humans, lead exposure can affect virtually all body systems, resulting in severe health problems.<br><br>On a molecular level, lead can alter or interfere with the activity of proteins and nucleic acids, ultimately<br><br>resulting in changes in cell metabolism and physiology leading to pathologic states. Lead can also affect the<br><br>functions of macromolecules, directly or indirectly, by inducing oxidative stress, which is regarded as a primary<br><br>factor in pathophysiology of lead exposure.<
