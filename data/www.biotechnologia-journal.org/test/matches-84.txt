/div><div>Bioeconomy is an important element of every economy. The foundations of bioeconomy are constituted by innovative biotechnology as its development (especially in a closed circuit) requires modern “biotechnologies”. In economy the resignation of elements such as achievements of modern biotechnology – although possible – is associated with a significant increase in development costs and a loss of access to innovative technologies that are essential for the today’s and future economy of the country. Furthermore, it is necessary to gain public acceptance for the emerging market of bioproducts, bioservices and bioprocesses. Legislation amendments supporting innovation in general, and bio domains in particular, are also a necessity. The current state of Polish biotechnology is presented on the basis of detailed studies and published on the website of the Biotechnology Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences (www.kbiotech.pan.pl):<i>Biotechnological centers in Poland – Map of Polish biotechnology.</i><
