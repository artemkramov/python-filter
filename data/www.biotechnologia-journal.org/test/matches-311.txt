/div><div>Plant chloroplasts emit signals that regulate the expression of nuclear-encoded genes, a process known as<i>retrograde<br><br>signaling</i>. Environmental stresses, such as rapid and dynamic changes in light intensity and quality, temperature,<br><br>relative humidity, water and CO2 availability, cause excess absorption of light energy (EEE) and induce<br><br>chlorophyll fluorescence and heat dissipation, which lead to the generation of singlet stages of dioxygen, chlorophyll<br><br>and carotenoid molecules. These primary quantum events in photosynthesis induce secondary redox reactions<br><br>in photosystems, e.g. electrical charge separation, chloroplast lumen acidification and activation of<br><br>the xanthophyll cycle by means of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), redox reactions between the photosynthetic<br><br>electron carriers (electron transport), and formation of reactive oxygen species. These, in turn, induce cascades<br><br>of physiologically regulated redox reactions in the chloroplast stroma metabolism that regulate cellular light<br><br>memory. Recently published data suggest that plants, with the help of EEE, NPQ, photoelectrochemical-redox<br><br>retrograde signaling and cellular light memory, are able to perform biological processing in order to optimize their<br><br>photosynthesis, transpiration, light acclimatory and defense responses, and in consequence, their Darwinian<br><br>fitness. Understanding of the above-mentioned processes is crucial for future biotechnological amelioration of<br><br>crop production.<
