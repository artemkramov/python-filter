/div><div>Rye has been generally considered to be recalcitrant to the androgenesis induction in vitro. The haploids of Secale<br><br>cereale are not easily obtainable and the isolated microspore technique application is difficult, thus is performed<br><br>occasionally, and in a limited number of strains and cultivars. The aim of the conducted experiment was to assess<br><br>the frequency of mechanical damage in microspores after their isolation in the mortar, and the effect of the pretreatment<br><br>of spikes at 4°C on microspore viability and the course of the culture. The analyses in the isolated<br><br>microspore culture were conducted on 30 genotypes of rye from two breeding programs and differing in their origin.<br><br>Spikes with microspores in the unicellular stage were cut and exposed to a temperature of 4°C for a period<br><br>of 2 to 42 days. Microspore observations were conducted immediately after the microspore isolation in order to<br><br>assess the viability and percentage of the damaged ones. In order to study the mitotic divisions first, cultures of<br><br>rye microspores were examined after 3 days. The highest microspore viability after isolation was observed for<br><br>strain 1283C – 91.9% and inbred line S1152/10 – 91.8%, while it was the lowest for F1 hybrid S02779/10 – 79.8%<br><br>and strain 1252E – 84%, respectively. It was found that to maintain high (microspore – to mozna opuscic) viability,<br><br>microspores must be isolated after low temperature stress (+4°C) applied for up to 7 days of culture. A considerable<br><br>extension of the duration of low temperature (36-42 days) resulted in a reduction of the microspore isolation<br><br>efficiency in rye (a lower number of microspores in the obtained suspension) and a slight reduction of<br><br>microspore viability.<
