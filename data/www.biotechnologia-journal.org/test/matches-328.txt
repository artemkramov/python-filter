/div><div>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. This reaction constitutes<br><br>the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis in most organisms, while its product also serves as a universal precursor<br><br>for various other high-value compounds. The important regulatory and rate-limiting role of acetyl-CoA<br><br>carboxylase makes this enzyme a powerful tool in a variety of biotechnological and medical projects. This review<br><br>presents the current knowledge on structural and functional features of the enzyme and focuses on its divergent<br><br>applications. Different metabolic engineering attempts that lead to the production of various compounds, such<br><br>as fatty acids, polyketides or flavonoids, are presented and their advantages and limitations discussed. The importance<br><br>of studies on acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity for design and development of new herbicides and antibiotics<br><br>as well as for medical intervention is also highlighted.<
