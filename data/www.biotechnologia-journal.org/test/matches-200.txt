/div><div><i>Aspergillus niger</i>FBT1, a local extracellular strain for tannase production, was isolated from soil collected from<br><br>Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Perak, Malaysia. This fungus strain was cultivated in an Erlenmeyer flask<br><br>under a submerged fermentation system. Medium compositions play a very important role in enhancing enzyme<br><br>production during fermentation. The production of tannase by A. niger FBT1 increased significantly (95%) when<br><br>the medium compositions and various process parameters were optimized. Incubation for 72 hours (30EC, pH<br><br>7) in medium complemented with sodium nitrate was found optimal. Additional supplementation with tannic acid<br><br>(2% w/v) as the sole carbon source strongly increased the yield of the enzyme.<
