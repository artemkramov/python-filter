/div><div>Nanoparticles of metal oxides are widely used in bionanotechnology, particularly in bio-medical applications; e.g., construction of biosensors, separation of biological materials, molecular imaging, and anticancer and antimicrobial therapies. However, synthesis of these nanoparticles using physico-chemical methods is problematic, because such procedures require high-temperature processes and harsh chemical treatments. The use of peptides specifically binding particular nanoparticles or nanostructures and facilitating their synthesis appears to be an encouraging alternative. Specific peptides capable of such reactions may be identified with the use of the phage display method. In this mini-review, zinc oxide is discussed as an exemple material whose nanoparticles can be bound and synthesized by such peptides exposed on the surface of bacteriophage capsids. An analysis of reports on studies into methods of peptide-aided synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles has indicated that, despite the encouraging results obtained so far, further studies are necessary to optimize such procedures. This may also be true for nanoparticles of other materials, particularly metal oxides.<
