/div><div>Lampbrush Chromosomes (LBCs) are present in the oocytes of birds, lower vertebrata and invertebrates during<br><br>the prolonged prophase of the first meiotic division. Their name stems from their similarity to bottle brushes.<br><br>Lampbrush chromosome of the early prophase is a bivalent, made up of two conjugating homologues. The axis<br><br>of each homologous chromosome is formed by sister chromatids that are differentiated into regions of transcriptionally<br><br>active and inactive chromatin. Transcription activity of LBCs is observed as a mantle of symmetrically<br><br>distributed side loops along the chromosome axis. Changes in transcriptional activity are reflected in changes in<br><br>their morphology. Transcriptional activity of LBCs is directly connected with physiological processes of the body<br><br>and shows in the morphological structure of the chromosomes. The use of cytogenetic techniques and in situ<br><br>hybridization have made it possible to identify unique and repeating sequences as well as DNA replication proteins<br><br>in LBCs. Particularly, interesting prospects are offered by the possibility of using LBCs in studies of transcriptional<br><br>activity, cytogenetic investigations of karyotype evolution and genome mapping.<
