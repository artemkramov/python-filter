/div><div>Biosurfactants-producing bacteria were isolated from various palm oil refinery industrial sites in the south of Thailand.<br><br>Isolates were screened for biosurfactant production by using low-cost, agro-industrial by-products or wastes<br><br>as a substrate. Based on drop collapsing test and emulsification activity, 25 isolates were selected. All the selected<br><br>isolates reduced the growth medium surface tension to 40 mN/m and produced emulsions with xylene. Twenty<br><br>isolates exhibited high emulsion-stabilizing capacity, maintaining more than 50% of the original emulsion volume<br><br>for 24 h. The phylogenetic position of these 25 isolates was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.The<br><br>production of biosurfactants was determined for strains representative of 15 different bacterial genera, six of them<br><br>(<i>Azorhizobium, Buttiauxella, Comamonas, Halopenitus, Haloplanus</i>and<i>Sinorhizobium</i>) have been for the first time<br><br>reported in this study as biosurfactant-producing strains. Additionally, Sinorhizobium meliloti AS91 and Marinobacter<br><br>hydrocarbonoclasticus AS51 produced extracellular biosurfactant which exhibited the lowest surface tension<br><br>(32 mN/m) and emulsification activity (69%) when cashew apple juice and used vegetable oil were used as the carbon<br><br>source, respectively. Overall, this is the first study of a phylogenetic analysis of biosurfactant-producing bacteria<br><br>from palm oil refinery industry site and their ability to produce biosurfactant on renewable substrates.<
