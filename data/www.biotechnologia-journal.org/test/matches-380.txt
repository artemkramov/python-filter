/div><div>Iron is a key component of many reactions in the human body, and by virtue of its ability to accept and donate<br><br>electrons, it is required for a variety of normal cellular functions and is vital for proper growth and development.<br><br>However, natural iron is rather insoluble and excess of iron is harmful since it can catalyze the formation of oxygen<br><br>radicals. Fortunately, there are also mechanisms for protecting human body from excess ‘free’ iron. This is<br><br>particularly important, given the fact that humans have very limited capacity to excrete iron. Therefore, cells have<br><br>developed mechanisms to improve the solubility of iron to control intracellular iron concentrations at the point<br><br>of iron absorption in the small intestine and other tissues. Since the described process is highly complex, a profound<br><br>understanding of all the relationships occurring among its components is possible when a systems approach<br><br>is applied to its analysis.<
