/div><div>The Polish economy is facing a green revolution with the implementation of European Union (EU) directive<br><br>2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. Poland could benefit substantially<br><br>from this shift as it has one of the highest hectarage per capita in the EU and therefore has land resources that<br><br>could be used for growing plant-based renewable energy sources. However, the development of domestic technologies<br><br>and know-how is essential if Poland is to take full advantage of the opportunities. Biotechnology should play<br><br>a pivotal role in the development of technologies which would lead to a bio-based economy for Poland. However,<br><br>this would require the synergistic action of many sectors: research and development, legislation, and essentially<br><br>capital investment. This review aims to summarise current biotechnological approaches to bioenergy and to demonstrate<br><br>how they relate to scientific and economic potential in Poland.<
