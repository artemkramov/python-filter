/div><div>Agro-industry by-products are abundant in various valuable compounds. Some of these raw materials are considered as a cheaper carbon source for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production when compared with pure substrates. It is however often a costly affair for industries to recover the residual carbon components. In this study, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] was produced using a marine<i>Bacillus megaterium</i>UMTKB-1 strain from sweetwater, a by-product from cane sugar refining process. The bioconversion was initiated in shaken-flasks and fermenter experiments. Applications of seawater and sweetwater mixture as well as sweetwater only as PHA culture media were investigated. The produced polymer was characterized using Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). P(3HB) accumulation from tested carbon sources ranged from 3 to 49 wt%. The strain could accumulate P(3HB) in saline conditions when minimal salts medium was replaced with seawater and sweetwater. The P(3HB) content was between 7 and 27 wt%. This strain was also able to grow and accumulate up to 14 wt% P(3HB) when sweetwater was the sole PHA biosynthesis medium. The weights of P(3HB) produced was in the range 3-12 × 105 with polydispersity index values ranging from 2.7 to 3.8. The agroindustry by-products have proven to be potential carbon feedstocks for P(3HB) production. The tested strain was able to grow and accumulate P(3HB) in a novel carbon substrate medium, the sweetwater. This by-product could be used as a raw material for P(3HB) production without any pretreatment.<
