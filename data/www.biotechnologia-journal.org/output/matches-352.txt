/div><div>In this paper, we have overviewed deterministic and stochastic approaches for the modeling of bio-molecular<br><br>reactions in systems biology. We have described and compared different versions of stochastic simulation<br><br>approaches towards the modeling of bio-molecular reaction systems, the direct approach and the family of the tauleap<br><br>methods. We also have illustrated differences between different approaches by providing numerical examples<br><br>of computational analyses for selected models. Computational examples of application of stochastic simulation<br><br>algorithms involved two systems of different interacting bio-molecular species and one model from the area of<br><br>ecology, describing interactions between two animal populations. Apart from the direct approach and tau-leap<br><br>family of methods, we have also overviewed the so called hybrid algorithm of stochastic simulations, proven to<br><br>be very efficient when there are huge differences between reaction rates in the system.<
