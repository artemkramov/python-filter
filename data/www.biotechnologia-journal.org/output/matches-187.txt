/div><div>Nucleic acid microarrays have recently become one of the basic techniques in the study of gene expression.<br><br>Owing to progress in the field of miniaturization, thousands of oligonucleotides differing in terms of their sequences<br><br>can be systematically placed on a small area of a solid support (usually glass). These probes are capable of<br><br>simultaneously interacting with a large number of longer nucleic acids from particular genes. Nucleic acid microarray<br><br>construction technology consists, primarily, of the appropriate functionalization of a glass surface with the<br><br>use of organofunctional silanes. Oligonucleotides known as probes are attached to a functionalized surface using,<br><br>for instance, the lithography technique and, after being linked to the surface, they are subjected to hybridization<br><br>with complementary and labelled fragments of nucleic acids known as samples of unknown sequences. In this<br><br>paper, we present a method for constructing DNA microarrays that is based on the use of microscopic slides modified<br><br>with epoxy functional group-containing silanes. This study was aimed at optimizing the production of DNA<br><br>microarrays. The study tested the usefulness of four different epoxy functional silanes with one or three alkoxy<br><br>groups. In addition, slides were silanized with the use of alkylsilane. The glass slides were characterized using<br><br>a goniometer and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The synthesized amino linker-containing oligonucleotide<br><br>probes were printed onto the glass slides in order to check the effectiveness of their attachment to the solid<br><br>surface.<
