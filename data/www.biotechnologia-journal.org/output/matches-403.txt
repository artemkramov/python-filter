/div><div>Previously, we have reported a T-DNA tagged mutant (TAG_009) of<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>exhibiting a significant<br><br>sensitivity to biotic stresses. We have also cloned and analyzed the tagged gene At5g46050. Based on bioinformatic<br><br>and molecular characterization, we proposed that At5g46050 is involved in the transport of peptides participating<br><br>in plant defense against biotic stresses. To provide further evidence for supporting our proposal, this time<br><br>we exposed this mutant to<i>Fusarium culmorum</i>, a potential fungal pathogen. Besides TAG_009 line, in our investigations<br><br>we included two SALK insertion mutants (SALK_003119 and SALK_145209), two wild-type ecotypes<br><br>(WT_C24 and WT_Col-0) and an additional T-DNA tagged mutant (TAG_197-6) of A. thaliana. We have found that<br><br>the highest degree of leaf damage was exhibited by TAG_009 line (damage score 4.37), whereas the lowest was<br><br>observed in WT_Col-0 ecotype (damage score 3.43). The highest rate of mortality after eight weeks of inoculation<br><br>with F. culmorum was also observed in TAG_009 line (85.24%), while the lowest was in WT_Col-0 line (37.22%).<br><br>We have also found that plants of SALK_145209 line, despite being infected with Fusarium, produced the highest<br><br>number of leaves (average 14.17 leaves per plant), whereas the lowest number of leaves was produced by plants<br><br>of TAG_197-6 line ( average 9.5 leaves per plant). Statistical analyses showed that the differences between the<br><br>T-DNA tagged line TAG_009 and WT_Col-0 were significant, whereas in comparison with wild-type control plants<br><br>WT_C24, they were insignificant. Based on these results, we can conclude that the gene we have tagged by using<br><br>T-DNA-mediated in vivo gene fusion is indeed involved in the plant defense against Fusarium infection.<
