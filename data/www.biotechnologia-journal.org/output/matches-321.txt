/div><div>Microorganisms that efficiently conduct several metabolic processes can be found among the microflora that colonizes<br><br>the natural environment. The aim of this study was to select non-pathogenic cultures of bacteria from the genus<br><br><i>Clostridium</i>which capable of converting glycerol into 1,3-propylene glycol from the glycerol-supplemented<br><br>methane fermentation medium. Moreover, analyses was performed in which best isolates were tested in terms<br><br>of 1,3-propylene glycol production using both pure and waste glycerol. Trials in a microreactor scale were performed<br><br>for the best strains identified. Thes trials were aimed at the determination of the effect of pH and temperature<br><br>conditions on the effectiveness and duration of 1,3-PD synthesis. Metabolite contents in the culture fluid<br><br>were assessed using HPLC. Species were identified by amplification of 16S rRNA coding sequence. A total of 67<br><br>isolates were identified, of which a vast majority was capable of synthesizing 1,3-PD. The best results were<br><br>obtained for strain<i>C butyricum</i>DS30. Maximum concentration of 1,3-PD for this strain exceeded 38.56 g/l. At<br><br>a temperature of 37EC and constant pH of 7.0, the efficiency of this strain fell within the range of 0.66-0.67<br><br>mol/mol glycerol in the case of laboratory and bioreactor scales using pure and waste glycerol.<
