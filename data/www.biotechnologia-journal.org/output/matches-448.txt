/div><div>Bioeconomy, biotechnology and genetically-modified organisms in particular have been the subject of discussion for a long time. Biotechnology is applied in a variety of economic areas which include biopharmaceuticals, biobased products and agriculture. During the last 20 years, innovative biotechnological techniques for plant genome improvement have been developed. Many factors worldwide have led to the status quo : different legislations around the world, the lack of public acceptance in the EU and high expectations for new strategies for sustainability and food security. Therefore, a clear regulatory status for new techniques is crucial for research and development, as well as for their practical implementation. This should be based on solid science which plays a critical role in developing the bioeconomy.<
