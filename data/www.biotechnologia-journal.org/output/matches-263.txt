/div><div>The aim of the study was to determine changes in phytotoxicity levels during bioremediation of soil contaminated<br><br>with 5% (v/w) diesel oil and find their correlation with the effectiveness of hydrocarbon degradation. Bioremediation<br><br>trials were performed using a<i>Gordonia alkanivorans</i>S7 strain. The clean-up process was enhanced through<br><br>the addition of dried fungal enzymatic preparations obtained from fungi Phanerohaete chrysosporium and<i>Aspergillus<br><br>niger</i>. After 110 days of bioremediation the decrease in soil pollution ranged between 68 and 77% depending<br><br>on treatment conditions. Toxicological tests using marker plants revealed significant differences in the phytotoxicity<br><br>levels of soil during bioremediation, depending on the treatment variant. The addition of an enzymatic fungal<br><br>preparation to soil was found to accelerate the rate of contaminant degradation. The rate of hydrocarbon depletion<br><br>in subsequent phases of the remediation process was found to be correlated with the phytotoxicity level. The obtained<br><br>results provide evidence that phytotests can be useful tools for monitoring toxicity changes during<br><br>bioremediation either mediated only by bacteria or additionally stimulated by fungal enzymatic preparations.<
