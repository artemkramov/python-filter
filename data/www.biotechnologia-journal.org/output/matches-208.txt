/div><div>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in science and technology, and have been successfully applied<br><br>in plant tissue cultures. First of all, ANNs can simulate the growth of plants under different<i>in vitro</i>conditions.<br><br>Their usefulness has been confirmed in the estimation of biomass in plant cell cultures and the length of shoots<br><br><i>in vitro</i>, in the classification of somatic embryos, evaluation of the physical conditions of an<i>in vitro</i>environment,<br><br>and in the prediction of optimal conditions for<i>in vitro</i>culture to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity.<br><br>Secondly, with the help of various types of neural models,<i>in vitro</i>-regenerated plants are sorted, respectively,<br><br>to their quality and likeliness of further development. Thirdly, ANNs are capable of predicting plant behavior<br><br>during<i>in vitro</i>rhizogenesis and subsequent acclimatization to ex vitro conditions. Several neural and neurofuzzy<br><br>models for the aforementioned biological processes are reviewed in this paper. In addition, the fundamentals of<br><br>neural modeling, namely the construction of ANNs, are presented and their flexibility and attractiveness are<br><br>highlighted.<
