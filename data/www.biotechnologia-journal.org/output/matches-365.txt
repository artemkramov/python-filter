/div><div>In order to survive in the environment, a cell has to be able to maintain a constant influx of chemical substances<br><br>which provide nourishment, it also has to dispose of endogenous or exogenous toxins as well as must perceive<br><br>and exchange signalling molecules. Such movement needs to be selective and organised. This prerequisite is realised<br><br>by an array of membrane transporters, channels, carriers and pumps. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters<br><br>constitute the largest family of membrane transport proteins found in all organisms in every life domain.<br><br>Researches in recent years have shown recognition of the role that plant ABC transporters play in hormone<br><br>signalling, heavy metal tolerance, as well as natural product trafficking. In this review article we present plant<br><br>ABC transporters, their characteristic modular structure and importance in plant physiology. We also point out<br><br>the recent discoveries that describe their role in drought tolerance by modulation of abscisic acid traffic, and their<br><br>involvement in subcellular compartmentation of exogenous toxic compounds and/or natural products. Alongside<br><br>the gradually increasing number of results in fundamental research, plant ABC transporters begin to emerge as<br><br>novel targets for applied science. We present an outline of the work and ideas that may link genetic engineering<br><br>of ABC transporters with plant biotechnology. A particular attention is paid to the possibility of alleviating the<br><br>heavy metal stress and the production of secondary metabolites.<
