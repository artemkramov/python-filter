/div><div>Usage of the custom aCGH design provides the ability to detect copy number alternations (CNAs) with a very high<br><br>resolution in almost every genomic region. Since the detection rate of CNAs greatly depends on the quality of the<br><br>design, it is crucial to ensure the optimal probe coverage for the regions of interests. In this paper, we focus on<br><br>the problem of finding the best possible probe coverage for a given region and a predefined set of probes.<br><br>The lack of available probes at some places is a considerable problem which may lead to the decrease in the detection<br><br>rate of CNAs. We propose a new approach towards the generation of coverage with stable probe density.<br><br>The developed algorithms attempt to compensate the lack of probes in poorly covered regions by selecting<br><br>additional probes from their nearest neighborhood. Here we introduce evaluation measures that reflect density<br><br>stabilization along the covered region. Finally, we use these measures to compare our algorithms with other standard<br><br>approaches for coverage preparation.<
