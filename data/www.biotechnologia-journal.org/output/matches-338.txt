/div><div>In this paper a Petri net based model of the process of endothelial dysfunction is presented. The model describes<br><br>some selected aspects of this process and their relation with atherosclerosis. Models expressed in the language<br><br>of Petri net theory have, on the one hand, an intuitive graphical interpretation, and on the other hand, they can<br><br>be analyzed using rigorous mathematical methods. Such analysis and simulation of the net behavior can be supported<br><br>by many freely available software tools. Here, results of an analysis based on t-invariants of the proposed<br><br>model are presented. In particular, feasible t-invariants, MCT-sets and t-clusters have been calculated and their<br><br>biological meaning has been determined.<
