/div><div>Carnivorous plants belong to endangered species. Due to agricultural development, natural populations of these<br><br>plants are diminishing. The herbal and ornamental value of these species has also led to their over-collection.<br><br>The<i>Drosera</i>genus is a natural source of pharmacologically important compounds (e.g. naphthoquinones, flavonoids,<br><br>anthocyanins, phenolic compounds) used as substrates in the production of pharmaceuticals.<i>Drosera</i>e herba<br><br>has been in use as an expectorant, diuretic and antispasmodic agent. In recent years, the bacteriostatic and antitumour<br><br>activity of<i>Drosera</i>extracts has been reported. Carnivorous plants have become an important ornamental<br><br>element in botanical garden collections. This fact, as well as the low propagation rate in their natural environment,<br><br>is the reason for the in vitro propagation of carnivorous plants. From a single plant cultivated in vitro many<br><br>genetically identical clonal lines can be obtained through vegetative propagation. This technique allows for the<br><br>increase in the propagation rate of valuable plant material. Additionally, the use of biotic and abiotic elicitors<br><br>increases the synthesis of pharmacologically active compounds (bactericidal, bacteriostatic activity and cytotoxic<br><br>activity). Elicitors play a significant role in the production of secondary metabolites. They induce defense responses<br><br>in plants, which leads to the accumulation of secondary metabolites. In some cases, compounds not synthesized<br><br>normally by plants in their natural environment are produced upon elicitation. Elicitors induce the biosynthesis<br><br>of enzymes which take part in the production of secondary metabolites.<
