/div><div>Xylanases are used in the recycling of biomass and have other industrial applications including pulp bleaching.<br><br>These enzymes are also applied in the baking industry and for the manufacture of animal feed. Such technologies<br><br>as, for example, pulp bleaching entail high temperatures and high pHs. As a result, there is great demand from<br><br>industry for thermostable and halostable forms of xylanase. Due to the relatively high variation in the thermo- and<br><br>halo-stability of xylanases, feature selection was employed as a model to discover the important attributes of their<br><br>amino acid sequences affecting the thermo- and halo-stability of the enzyme. A data set containing the amino acid<br><br>sequences of xylanases with different thermo- and halostabilities was collected. Seventy-four amino acid attributes<br><br>were obtained for each enzyme sequence. After running a feature selection algorithm for each of the thermo- and<br><br>halostablity variables, features were classified as either important, unimportant or marginal. The results showed<br><br>a significant correlation between structural amino acid attitudes and stability in harsh temperatures or alkaline<br><br>conditions. Features such as lysine, glutamic acid, and positively/negatively charged residues showed a positive<br><br>correlation with both the thermostability and alkalophilicity attributes of the protein. For the first time, we found<br><br>attributes which were important for both stability at high temperatures as well as in alkaline conditions by mining<br><br>sequence-derived amino acid attributes using data mining.<
