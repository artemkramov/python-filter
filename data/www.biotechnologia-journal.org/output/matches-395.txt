/div><div>Higher air temperature in summer causes a significant reduction in fertility in cattle. Increase in female body temperature<br><br>during the period of reproduction by only 2°C, also known as hyperthermia, leads to disturbances in the<br><br>functioning of the female reproductive system, oocytes maturation, fertilization and embryos development.<br><br>Particularly sensitive to high temperatures are embryos in the first and second day after fertilization (thermosensitive),<br><br>but just at third till fifth day after fertilization their resistance to thermal stress significantly increases.<br><br>Morula-stage and blastocyst-stage bovine embryos are insensitive to elevated temperatures (thermoresistant).<br><br>Most probably this is due to the increasing number of cells within the embryo and the capacity to activate defense<br><br>mechanisms based on the synthesis of various factors providing resistance to high temperatures. These factors<br><br>include heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), antioxidants such as glutathione, and IGF-1. One of the responses of the<br><br>embryo to elevated temperature is the induction of apoptosis, which is associated with the activation of embryonic<br><br>genome. Owing to the apoptosis, cells damaged by high temperature may be eliminated from the embryo, which<br><br>increases their chance of survival. Precise examination of the mechanisms responsible for the development of<br><br>thermotolerance of preimplantation bovine embryos will enable their protection from the consequences of elevated<br><br>temperature. The aim of this review is to summarise experiments in which in vitro embryo production<br><br>system was used to estimate the influence of elevated temperature on cattle fertility.<
