/div><div>In this report, a novel, reproducible and efficient protocol for protuberance-mediated adventitious shoot regeneration<br><br>has been established for sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.]. The leaf explants were cultured on a modified<br><br>Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing various concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 or 10 μM) of Thidiazuron<br><br>(TDZ). The adventitious shoots were developed from the base of leaf explants on an MS medium supplemented<br><br>with 2.0, 5.0 or 10.0 μM TDZ. The responsive explants were transferred to a freshly modified MS medium<br><br>containing TDZ. Green-colored, oval, or cone-shaped shoot-forming protuberances were developed from explants.<br><br>It appeared that the frequency of protuberance development depended on the concentration of TDZ. However,<br><br>this did not further improve, when the concentration of TDZ increased from 5.0 μM to 10.0 μM. Adventitious<br><br>shoot buds were developed from protuberances, and the histology of protuberances revealed a direct origin<br><br>of shoot buds. In vitro raised shoots were rooted either on a modified MS medium alone or on a modified MS<br><br>medium containing indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The regenerated plants were acclimatized and successfully<br><br>established in a greenhouse.<
