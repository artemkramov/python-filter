/div><div>Short hybridization probes bind their targets with greater base pairing fidelity, but with lower affinity than longer<br><br>probes. Furthermore, their target sequence is shorter, and thus more likely not to be unique in a given genome.<br><br>Long hybridization probes provide increased affinity, and their sequences are more unique, but their duplexes<br><br>tolerate mismatches more readily, without a significant depression in melting point. It was reasoned that segmenting<br><br>longer hybridization probes by introducing flexible, abasic linkers might lead to oligonucleotides that<br><br>retain some of the sequence selectivity of short probes without losing too much of the target affinity of their unsegmented<br><br>counterparts. A model study led to 1,3-propandiol-phosphates as linker residues. These spacer residues<br><br>were introduced at different positions of hybridization probes 8-20 residues in length and their hybridization<br><br>properties were studied in UV-melting curves with RNA or DNA target strands. Increases in base pairing selectivity<br><br>(ΔΔTm of up to -7.4°C for a single mismatch) and decreased target affinities (ΔΔ<i>Tm</i>between -15 and -25°C)<br><br>were found for the segmented probes when compared to their unsegmented counterparts, and so was a decreased<br><br>selectivity for insertions at the site of the linker. Also, the increases in selectivity are not uniform in their<br><br>magnitude and depend on sequence context and position. A favorable case appears to be a hybridization probe<br><br>that contains two spacers, with one octamer as core segment, flanked by a heptamer and a pentamer as terminal<br><br>segments.<
