/div><div>The identification of associations between molecular markers and agronomic traits provides an excellent tool for<br><br>indirect selection of traits of interest in a population. In this study, a stepwise regression analysis was used to<br><br>estimate associations between inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA<br><br>(RAPD) markers with some agronomic traits in barley genotypes. Two-year average values for the measured traits<br><br>under rain-fed and irrigation conditions were used for association analyzes. Thirty-one random RAPD and 20 ISSR<br><br>primers were used in the study. The results of the stepwise regression analysis revealed significant associations<br><br>between the traits and some of the studied loci. For all traits more than one informative marker was detected.<br><br>A total of 88 informative markers, including 32 ISSR loci and 56 RAPD loci, were identified under both tested<br><br>conditions. OPC4-1050, E17-400, and E19-1100 markers were associated with grain yield, biomass and spike<br><br>length, respectively, under both tested conditions. These markers are relatively more reliable than other<br><br>identified markers. Among the RAPD primers, special attention should be drawn to primer E17, which produced<br><br>the highest number of fragments associated with traits such as biomass, plant height, spike length and number<br><br>of seeds per spike, under rain-fed conditions. Moreover, the UBC856 ISSR primer revealed loci associated with<br><br>grain yield, plant height and number of sterile spikelets per spike under irrigated conditions.<
