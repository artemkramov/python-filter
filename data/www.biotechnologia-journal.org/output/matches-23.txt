/div><div>An efficient mass propagation system for a rapid delivery of pro-vitamin A cassava varieties to farmers is essential for acquiring food sufficiency and reducing vitamin A deficiency in Africa. The study investigated multiple shoot inductions from axillary buds of three pro-vitamin A enriched cassava varieties using a combination of 10 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.1-0.5 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Growth, photosynthetic pigment content and molecular stability of the regenerated plants with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers are also assessed. Shootbud formation in TMS 30572 variety was found to be 8.9% higher than in the three pro-vitamin A varieties. But, the number of regenerated shoots was higher by 7.3% in pro-vitamin A varieties than in TMS 30572. The formation of roots was outstanding in UMUCASS 38. Root carotene contents of regenerated and mother plants were not different. The highest number of shootbuds per explant and frequency of regenerated shoots were obtained through a medium containing 10 mg/l BAP and 0.3 mg/l NAA. The RAPD analysis of regenerated plants showed a uniform profile of 1628 bands among the regenerants and mother plants. The study concluded that a combination of 10 mg/l BAP and 0.3 mg/l NAA enhances a multiple shoot induction with no genetic infidelity of regenerated plants.<
