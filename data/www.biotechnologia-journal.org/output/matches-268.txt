/div><div>Rather than ask consumers via questionnaires and polls about their attitudes to GM-foods and if they would buy<br><br>them, the CONSUMERCHOICE study sought to determine whether European consumers actually did purchase<br><br>GM-labelled food products in those countries participating in the project in which they were on sale (the Czech<br><br>Republic, Poland, Spain and The Netherlands in this inquiry). The results showed (a) that indeed they did, and<br><br>(b) that what consumers said in questionnaires with respect to GM-foods was not a reliable guide to what they<br><br>did when buying their food supplies. A survey of the behaviour of Polish and UK citizens living in or visiting North<br><br>America revealed that they took little or no action to avoid the widespread use of (unlabelled) GM-products in<br><br>Canada and the United States.<
