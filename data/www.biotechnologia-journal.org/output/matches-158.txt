The subject of the invention is the use of 4-furfurylcytosine and /or its derivatives in anti-aging compositions. As 4-furfurylcytosine and /or its derivatives possesses a series of biological properties it might be use as a composition having excellent anti-aging effect to prevent the sagging of skin and loss of luster and to improve sufficiently its aesthetic appearance without significantly change the growth rate and the total growth ability of the skin.</div
