/div><div>A study of cell-wall regeneration was conducted on protoplast cultures of four recalcitrant plant species: yellow<br><br>lupin and grasspea (grain legumes), and also hyacinth and asparagus (ornamental monocots). The rate of cell wall<br><br>resynthesis was investigated together with the arrangement of cellulosic fibers on the surface of protoplast-derived<br><br>cells. Localization of arabinogalactan proteins in cell walls was also performed. Quick cell wall renewal occurred<br><br>in grasspea and hyacinth cultures, where the percentage of protoplast-derived cells after 24h of culture accounted<br><br>for 45-50%. In contrast, the presence of cell walls in half of the population was not observed in asparagus<br><br>and lupin cultures until 5 and 7 days later, respectively. Grasspea, hyacinth and asparagus cells budded intensively.<br><br>Moreover, the cellulosic material of the cell wall was disorganized and unevenly distributed in lupin, asparagus<br><br>and hyacinth. In all the tested species arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) were detected mainly in spherical cells<br><br>with condensed cytoplasm, but were absent in the budding cells. Notwithstanding the observed differences among<br><br>species, we concluded that incorrect cell wall structure/composition, together with a deregulated cell cycle might<br><br>contribute to protoplast recalcitrance in the examined plants. Abnormalities could be a result of the isolation<br><br>process itself and defective stress-recovering mechanisms. Subsequently, these could arrest regeneration competences<br><br>and direct cells at apoptotic pathways.<
