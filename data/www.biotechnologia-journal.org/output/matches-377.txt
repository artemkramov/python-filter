/div><div>There are several risk factors whose association with atherosclerosis, a chronic disease with complicated etiology,<br><br>is well established, including age, gender, smoking, lipids metabolism disorders, diabetes mellitus, obesity and reduced<br><br>physical activity. Surprisingly, many cardiovascular related deaths occur in individuals without standard<br><br>risk factors, so it has been suggested that these cases must be the result of other factors, previously not taken<br><br>into account. This phenomenon resulted in the development of research focused on finding new risk factors.<br><br>In 1981, Sullivan first postulated the so-called “iron hypothesis”, suggesting that the regular menstrual iron loss,<br><br>rather than other known effects of estrogen, protects women against coronary heart disease. It is widely believed<br><br>at present, that iron is an essential catalyst in the oxidation and oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein<br><br>cholesterol which appears to be one of the pivotal steps in the early phase of the formation of the atherosclerotic<br><br>plaque. Thus, iron depletion through menstrual loss might reduce oxidative stress and beneficially affect atherogenesis.<br><br>Stored iron appears to be essential in the process of atherogenesis which is strictly required for normal<br><br>cellular metabolism but also serves as a reservoir from which toxic-active iron can be liberated under atherogenic<br><br>stimuli and result in lipid peroxidation. In this process, two pathways i.e., iron homeostasis metabolic pathway<br><br>and metabolic pathways involving proinflammatory cytokines are closely interconnected. In human monocytes,<br><br>these cytokines also increase the uptake of non-transferrin-bound iron, via the stimulation of divalent metal transporter-<br><br>1 synthesis and cause iron retention by down-regulating ferroportin synthesis. It has been found recently<br><br>that iron depositions are prominent in human atherosclerosis lesions. It can therefore be concluded that the<br><br>results of scientific research, particularly those of the last ten years, provide a strong pathological basis to support<br><br>the role of iron metabolism alterations in vascular damage and in the progression of atherosclerosis process.<
