/div><div>Intense development of the transport sector and a rise in the prices of fossil fuels boost the demand for fuels from<br><br>alternative sources of energy, including biofuels. Thus, new energy-efficient technologies of fuel production from<br><br>renewable resources are being developed. Accordingly, we attempted to create a technology of bioethanol production<br><br>by simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of native corn starch. In our work we used commercially<br><br>available STARGEN 001 enzymatic preparation for native corn starch hydrolyzis, and yeast Saccharomyces<br><br>cerevisiae strain Red Star Ethanol Red for it’s fermentation. A major part of the research was on developing<br><br>a fermentation technology with repeated full recirculation of stillage liquid fraction. It has been shown that<br><br>a completely effluentless ethanol production with separation of stillage solid fraction and using the liquid fraction<br><br>to prepare the next portion of corn mash is possible. Thus the process can proceed for several months without<br><br>any effluent.<
