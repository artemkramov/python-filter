/div><div>It appears that the presence of labile iron pool (LIP, iron not bound to proteins) in cells can result in the production<br><br>of reactive oxygen species namely COH radical which may be responsible for the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-<br><br>2N-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the cellular DNA. This oxidatively modified molecule is regarded as a good<br><br>biomarker of cancer risk and a general index of oxidative stress in relation to other diseases. There are numerous<br><br>data suggesting that oxidative stress may be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases and cancer.<br><br>It has been observed that heterozygosity for hereditary hemochromatosis (a disease with abnormal iron storage)<br><br>is a risk factor for vascular diseases. Previously we have demonstrated higher levels of LIP in a group of atherosclerotic<br><br>patients when compared with the control group. This suggests that LIP may increase the risk of disease<br><br>development. The aforementioned condition may lead to oxidative stress, which is manifested by a higher level<br><br>of 8-oxodG in blood lymphocytes, and may be one of the factors responsible for the development of cardiovascular<br><br>diseases. We have also reported the relationship between LIP and the endogenous level of 8-oxodG in human<br><br>lymphocytes of the colon cancer patients. Good correlation has been determined between LIP and oxidatively modified<br><br>nucleoside. The results of our studies on piglets supplemented with iron dextran (FeDex) also show an increase<br><br>in the 8-oxodG level in hepatic DNA. These findings confirm the possibility that iron overload may favor<br><br>the persistence of harmful LIP which may catalyze generation of the potentially carcinogenic 8-oxodG moiety in<br><br>the cellular DNA.<
