/div><div>This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor Edward Pojnar (1919-2011), Head of the Department of<br><br>Botany (1974-1990) at the University of Agriculture in Krakow, who initiated research on isolated plant protoplasts<br><br>in Poland. Studying in Professor E.C. Cocking’s Plant Physiology Laboratory at the University of Nottingham,<br><br>Professor Pojnar became acquainted with the enzymatic method procedure for protoplast isolation.<br><br>His postdoctoral thesis was published in 1969 as the first paper on protoplast isolation and culture procedures<br><br>in Poland. The present paper is a survey of Professor Pojnar’s research, as well as further studies inspired by his<br><br>pioneering achievements. Recent research into protoplast technology, focused on the structural changes involved<br><br>in protoplast regeneration, is also discussed.<
