/div><div>Phytohormones (plant hormones) play a role in the regulation of cellular activities including cell division, elongation<br><br>and differentiation, pattern formation, organogenesis, reproduction, sex determination, and responses to<br><br>abiotic and biotic stress. The phytohormonal signal transduction pathways operate<i>via</i>cytokinin perception by<br><br>transmembrane receptors consisting of two domains: an extracellular domain responsible for hormone binding<br><br>and an intracellular domain, sensory His / Asp kinase (HK). Upon phytohormone binding, the receptor undergoes<br><br>a conformational change which activates its protein kinase activity. The phosphorylated intracellular domain transfers<br><br>the phosphoryl group to the His residue of the histidine phosphotransfer protein (HPt) which in turn phosphorylates<br><br>Asp residue in the Response Regulator (RR). The phosphorylated RR protein acts as either a positive<br><br>or negative transcription factor that interacts with the gene promoter or other target protein. The two-component<br><br>signaling pathway, operating through the His-Asp phosphorelay, controls many physiological and developmental<br><br>processes throughout the plant lifecycle (from seed-to-seed). Downstream plant hormone signaling also includes<br><br>proteolysis of transcriptional regulators that block the activity of transcription factors. Two-component signaling<br><br>operates more frequently in higher plants. Five classic plant hormones had been discovered by the middle of the<br><br>twentieth century: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene and abscisic acid. The more recently characterized<br><br>hormones include brassinosteroids, strigolactones, jasmonates and salicylates. Considering the tremendous work<br><br>that has been undertaken during the last decades, in this review we decided to concentrate on cytokinin signaling<br><br>in various plant developmental processes, including responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.<
