miRNAs are short non-protein coding RNAs, being though a crucial regulators of gene expression of up to 90%<br><br>of human genes (Friedmann et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010; Perron and Provost, 2010; Bartel, 2009; Esquela-Kerscher<br><br>and Slack, 2006; Bartel, 2006; Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011; Selbach et al., 2008). These tiny RNA<br><br>molecules tune cell growth, tissue differentiation, cell proliferation, embryonic development, apoptosis and cellular<br><br>signaling (Gaur et al., 2007; Godlewski et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2006). Even slight shift in<br><br>miRNA level could lead to significant changes of transcriptome, and in a result of cell phenotype. In the last decade,<br><br>over 30 000 mature miRNA sequences were deposited in miRBase (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006). The function<br><br>of many of them have been found and anti-miRNA tools, as potential therapy approach have been designed.<br><br>Despite of an enormous data of miRNA, there are still many questions concerning miRNA function to be solved.<br><br>Following Francis Crick’s famous statement “If you want to understand function, study structure”, we were<br><br>looking for structure of mature miRNAs (Belter et al., 2014).</div
