/div><div>Economists and policymakers recognize the importance of having well-defined and strongly protected intellectual property rights. Intellectual Property (e.g.: patentable technology, designs, copyrights) have therefore become the most important assets for large companies, small and medium-sized ones, as well as for inventors. Patents are legal instruments that encourage innovation. The property protection system gives individuals an exclusive right to use their resources as they see fit. Securing exclusive rights to inventors is given in return for the disclosure of the invention. Unfortunately, in terms of innovation, Poland has not improved significantly in past decades. In this report I present recent accomplishments in the field of patenting in Poland.<
