/div><div>Parkinson’s disease is one of the most frequent human neurodegenerations. Motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease<br><br>are the consequence of the destruction of nervous cells in the substantia nigra (SN), a small (about 500 mg)<br><br>structure located deep in human brain. The concentration of iron in SN is comparable to that in liver and is equal<br><br>to about 180 ± 60 ng/mg of wet tissue and the iron in SN is mostly bound to ferritin. For many years it has been<br><br>believed that the degeneration of nervous cells in SN in Parkinson’s disease is related to an important increase<br><br>in the concentration of iron. Our own studies based on Mössbauer spectroscopy and other studies conducted with<br><br>the use of various techniques have not confirmed this finding. The ratio of the concentration of iron in PD vs.<br><br>control SN evaluated by Mössbauer spectroscopy was found to be equal 1.00±0.13. We also confirmed that most<br><br>of iron in SN is located within ferritin. ELISA studies demonstrated a significant decrease in L ferritin in parkinsonian<br><br>SN compared to the control group. As L-ferritin is related to safe keeping of iron within the ferritin shell,<br><br>its decrease may lead to an efflux of iron and increase in the concentration of labile iron. Indeed our studies did<br><br>show a difference in the concentration of labile iron between PD and control SN (135 ± 10 ng/g vs. 76 ± 5 ng/g).<br><br>This labile iron, which may initiate Fenton reaction, may be the cause of the oxidative stress leading to the death<br><br>of nervous cells in PD.<
