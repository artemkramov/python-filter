/div><div>Synthetic biology is the field of biology that is involved in the manufacturing of genomic material designed by man with subsequent introduction into a chassis. A synthetic life has a minimal genome of about 500-800 genes as well as a few additional genes required to fulﬁll a particular task. Synthetic life forms can be used for the production of valuable target compounds such as the antimalarial drug artemisinin. This technology is applicable to all subfields of biotechnology and biology, but it is, in particular, relevant for the making of target compounds; it can be used for the making of biofuels, drugs, energy, artificial photosynthesis, in medicine, bioremediation/biosensors, in the chemical industry, and in agriculture. It is believed that these novel artificial strains will become the ruling strains in the near future with many a use in many a field. This paper outlines the positive aspects of synthetic life forms as well as the methods used to generate artificial life forms.<
