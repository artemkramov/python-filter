/div><div>The WRKY proteins are one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in plants. Their biosynthesis is<br><br>induced during certain stages of plant development and upon pathogen infection. A single WRKY transcription<br><br>factor may be involved in the regulation of several apparently disparate processes. Their hallmark is strong<br><br>conservation of the DNA binding domain which contains an invariant WRKYGQK amino acid sequence and a zinc<br><br>binding motif. However, the overall sequences of individual representatives are highly divergent. Little is known<br><br>about the 3D-structure of the WRKY proteins. Up to date there have only been results of structural strudies of<br><br>DNA binding domain available. In this review, the biological function as well the structural studies of the WRKY<br><br>proteins have been recapitulated.<
