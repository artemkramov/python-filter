/div><div>Interspecific hybridization is an important tool to transfer characters across species and develop synthetic amphidiploids,<br><br>and therefore it has been widely applied for improving Brassica spp. The aim of our study was to determine<br><br>whether the interspecific crosses can help increase the range of variability of traits connected with<br><br>the higher value of rapeseed. An attempt was also made to investigate the environmental influence on the studied<br><br>traits. For this reason, in our experiments, crosses between male sterile line of F8 generation and<i>B. campestris</i><br><br>ssp. sarson, Yellow sarson;<i>B. campestris</i>ssp. pekinensis;<i>B. carinata</i>and<i>B. juncea</i>were first attempted. Thereafter,<br><br>hybrid seeds of 96 lines obtained by crossing Brassica napus male sterile line MS8 with three other Brassica<br><br>species were tested for fiber and glucosinolates content using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS).<br><br>Moreover, chromatography and spectrophotometric measurements of sinapine and tocopherols contents in those<br><br>seeds were made. On the basis of the obtained results, it was found that all tested hybrid lines showed a great<br><br>increase of variability for the studied quality traits when compared to the parental forms. As a result of our<br><br>analyses, reduced glucosinolates hybrid lines were selected.<
