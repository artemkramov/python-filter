The aim of our invention is to characterize a modified gene of human activation-induced cytidine deaminase (hAID ), a method of modification of hAID gene, a composition showing hAID activity, and a method of preparation of such composition in a bacterial system. In particular, the invention concerns a modified hAID gene for the production of an active enzyme in a bacterial system as well as use of such composition for the analyzes of DNA/RNA amination/deamination, and/or methylation/demethylation.</div
