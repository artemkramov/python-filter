It is investigated the impact of low temperature thermal annealing on optical properties of organic- polymer spincoated dyes. It was obtained, that thermal annealing at heightened temperatures leads to diminishing of organic component within an organic dye, which causes decreasing of its layer thickness. It is shown that thermal treatment also renders topological structuring of on organic dye surface. The thermal treatments also cause decreasing of intensity of light absorption of investigated dyes and simultaneous increasing their refraction index. Tabl.: 2. Fig.: 6. Refs: 13 titles.
