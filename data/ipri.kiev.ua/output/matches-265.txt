The results of analysis on the photosensitive properties of materials with nonlinear exposition characteristic have been performed. It is shown that some photo(thermo)sensitive materials allow to register the image of elements having sizes less than the diameter of exposing beam. The results of laser writing to inorganic photoresists are presented. Fig.: 3. Refs: 21 titles.
