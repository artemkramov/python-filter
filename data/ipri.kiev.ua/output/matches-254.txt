Mathematical Models of Moving Objects
Tsybulska Е.O.
The mathematical formalization methods of the different type motion objects to create a model of the environment in an automated system for monitoring moving objects are considered. The motion objects are presented as an operation of basis transformation using the hyper-complex number system of quaternions. Fig.: 4. Refs: 5 titles.
