Analysis of the Impact of Structural Features of Diffractive Optical Modulators on Image Contrast
Yurlov V.I., Shylo S.О., Lapchuk A.S.
It is analyzed the processes associated with the contrast images generated by a scanning optical modulator (SOM). It is shown that the amplitude imbalance of the optical modulator elements is the principal limitation on maximal contrast in SOM and other light modulators. This phenomenon may be compensated by correct design and optimal choice of the sizes of both widths and holes of the modulator. Fig.: 9. Refs: 11 titles.
