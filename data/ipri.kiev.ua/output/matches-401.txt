Developed for practical use, the workbook template is built for project managers without programming experience. The size of the network model «works-hubs» with an expanded set of precedence relations is not limited. It is planned solving the problem of planning and scheduling of the project by critical path method (CPM) and simulation (PERT) reducing the duration of the project tasks in the «time-cost» construction time schedule and resource demand of the circuit network model.
