Construction of Sensemaking Systems on the Basis of a Paradigm of Limiting Generalizations
Prokopchuk I.A.
A method of construction of sensemaking systems on the basis of a paradigm of limiting generalizations is proposed. In this method, a test configurator bank and a precedent bank are generated for each control Z-problem. Then limiting knowledge models are formed automatically to solve the target Z- problem. The test bank, a system pattern space, sketch digraphs of the precedent base and the knowledge models form the basis of a sensemaking system. Fig.: 3. Refs: 13 titles.
