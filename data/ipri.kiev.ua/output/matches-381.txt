Self-learning neural network technologies in the systems of structural recognition of visual objects
Berestovskii A.E., Vlasenko A.N., Gorokhovatskiy V.A.
The issues of analysis and image recognition in intelligent systems of computer vision were discussed. Based on Kohonen network, there was proposed technology of self-recognition for the system of structural recognition of visual objects. As a result, the transformation of descriptions to the vector format takes place, which reduces the computational cost. The results of experiments are shown. Tabl.: 5. Fig.: 4. Refs: 7 titles.
