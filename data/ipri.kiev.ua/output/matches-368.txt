Estimation of quality of reference patterns for the correlation-extreme navigation systems
Yuzefovych V.V., Butochnov O.Н., Mezentsev А.V., Myronyuk S.V.
A decision of task of estimation of quality of reference patterns of surface which is created for the correction of flight of the guided aircrafts, due to the correlation-extreme systems of navigation is exam-ined in the article. It is suggested to solve this task by analysis of characteristics of criterion function of comparison of current and etalon images with their possible distortions. Fig.: 4. Refs: 4 titles.
etalon image, current image, estimation of quality, inter-correlation function, difference function.
