Visibility Graph as a Tool for the Network Analysis of Measurement Series
Snarskii A.A., Lande D.V.
An overview of the network analysis methods of the measurements series based on algorithms for constructing visibility graphs is given. The original dynamic visibility of graph algorithms and compa-ctified horizontal visibility graph for the language network has been described. Fig.: 4. Refs: 30 titles.
