Optical Properties of Galvanic Series of Matrices for Microrelief Light Reflective Structures
Antonov E.E., Pankratova A.V., Shyhovets A.V.
The optical properties of a series of galvanic copies of matrixes of light reflective structures and mi-croprismatic devices have been investigated. The angular diagrams of light reflection have been defined for different matrices of reflectors and an analysis of the possibility of using nickel copies of the original matrix to make reflectors and microprismatic elements have been performed.
