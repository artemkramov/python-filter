Increasing the channel capacity of a part of telecommunivation network at the expense of space-energy multiplexing.
Anakhov P.V.
A scheme of the hybrid communication system with division of channels by environments of signals transmittance, their physical nature and frequency-time is presented. A formula for calculating the channel capacity to be increased on account of space-energy multiplexing is derived. Tabl.: 1. Fig.: 1. Refs: 10 titles.
