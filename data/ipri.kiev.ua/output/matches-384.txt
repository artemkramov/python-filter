Synthesis of matrix representations of generalized quaternions
Kalinovsky J.A., Boyarinova Y.E., Sukalo A.S.
It is synthesized matrix representations of a class of non-commutative hypercomplex number sys-tems of the fourth dimension built with the help of non-commutative procedures of doubling of the Grassmann-Clifford systems of the second dimension. Refs: 12 titles.
