Investigation of properties of generalized hyper-number systems of the fourth order found with help of the Grassmann-Clifford doubling procedure
Kalinovsky J.A., Boyarinova Y.E., Sukalo A.S.
Using the Grassmann-Clifford doubling procedure, the generalized hyper-complex number systems (HNS) of the fourth order has been formed. Available options in the definition of these systems makes them a generalization of whole classes of various HNS. It has been studied the algebraic and functional properties of generalized HNS and their relationship with the HNS lower dimensions. Refs: 23 titles.
