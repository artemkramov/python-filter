A Reduction Method on Finding Out Signal Parameter’s Calculation of the Output of Multi-channel Device of Otimal Spatial-Temporal Treatment of Signals
Mezentsev A.
The study presented is the first of its kind to identify the new method of determination of criterion’s value of correlation of signal to (the hindrance + a noise) of the output of multichannel device of optimal spatial-temporal treatment of signals on a background different origin hindrances in the conditions of plenty of spatial and temporal channels of reception that allows to promote the fast-acting of special calculators by the radio-location stations. Refs: 3 titles.
spatial-temporal treatment of signals, cross-correlation matrix, a correlation of signal to (the hindrance + a noise), active and passive hindrances, combined hindrances, dimension, spatial and temporal channels of reception.
