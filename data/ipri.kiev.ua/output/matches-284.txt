Modern Videoadapter Architectures. GPGPU Technology (Part 1)
Pogorilyy S.D, Vitel D.Yu, Vereshchynsky O.A.
A comparative analysis of new videoadapters architectures (Tesla, Fermi and Kepler) and development tools for NVidia CUDA applications creation has been performed. The basic methods of global memory usage are described. The methods on the flows forming to the abovementioned hardware and software platforms have been considered. Tabl.: 3. Fig.: 3. Refs: 10 titles.
