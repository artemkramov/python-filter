Improvement of Geophysical Instruments Based on Digital Laser Interferometry
Britsky O.I.
The results of studies on the use of digital laser interferometers to improve the accuracy characteris-tics, frequency and dynamic range of geophysical instruments: seismometers, delta-gravity meters and tilt-meters have been demonstrated. It is shown the expediency of using the digital interferometers for building the precision calibration vibration platforms. Fig.: 10. Refs: 6 titles.
