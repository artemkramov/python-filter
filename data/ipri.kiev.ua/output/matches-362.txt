Application of non-canonical hyper-complex numerical systems to optimize total parametric sensitivity of reversible digital filters
Kalinovsky Jа.A., Khitsko I.V.
Constructing optimal parametric sensitivity method based on using of non-canonical hypercomplex number systems (HNS) is proposed and investigated. It has been shown that the use of non-canonical HNS with grater number of non-zero structure constants in multiplication table can significantly improve the sensitivity of the digital filter.
