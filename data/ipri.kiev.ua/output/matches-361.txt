Granulation of object features values as a means of structural recognition methods efficiency rise
Gorokhovatskiy V.A., Kulikov Yu.A.
The issues of intelligent information processing systems of computer vision are discussed. It is proposed a method of forming a compressed structural description based on granulation of characteristic values that reduces the computational cost and reduces the number of false matches. The results of experiments are presented. Tabl.: 2. Fig.: 6. Refs: 8 titles.
