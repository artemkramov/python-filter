Mathematical modeling representations of exponential and logarithmic functions in the hypercomplex numerical system of generalized quaternions
Kalinovsky Y.A., Boyarinova Y.E., Sukalo A.S.
The process of mathematical modeling representations of exponential and logarithmic functions in hypercomplex number system using generalized quaternion defining a linear differential equation with hypercomplex coefficients is being considered. Some properties of these representations and their relationship with the concepts of exponents in specific non-commutative hypercomplex numerical systems dimension four have been considered. Refs: 21 titles.
