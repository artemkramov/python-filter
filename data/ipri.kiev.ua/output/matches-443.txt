High stability temperature control of the laser diode for interferometry.
Kosyak I.V.
The analysis and research of systems temperature stabilization have been carried out. The features of the design and construction of automatic temperature control systems are considered. A realization of highly stable temperature control of the laser diode for interferometry is proposed. Tabl.: 1. Fig.: 10. Refs: 15 titles.
