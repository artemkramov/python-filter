Kalinovskiy J.A., Boyarinova Y.E., Sukalo A.S.
The process of constructing a class of commutative hypercomplex number systems of the fourth dimension with the help of doubling Grassmann-Clifford procedure has been considered. It has been synthesized representation of exponential and logarithmic functions of the hypercomplex variable in this class, and apply these methods to other classes of commutative hypercomplex numerical systems. Refs: 16 titles.
