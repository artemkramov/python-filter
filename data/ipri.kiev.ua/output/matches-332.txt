Studying the Properties of a Single Hypercomplex Generalization of Quaternions
Turenko A.S.
The basic properties of hypercomplex generalization of quaternions as anti-quaternions have been presented. Also, it is introduced the definition and investigated the anti-quaternions conjugation, their rate and zero divisor, and how to perform operations with them. Fig.: 2. Refs: 7 titles.
