Application of Semiconductor Digital Interferometers in High-Density Optical Recording and Geophysical Measurements
Britsky A.I.
The results of development and some results upon researches of digital semiconductor inter-ferometers are presented. The possibility of their use in nano-measurements, particularly for laser beam control in high-density optical data storage, seismic measurements and gravimetry, has been clearly demonstrated. Fig.: 9. Refs: 6 titles.
