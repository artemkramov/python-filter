Principle of Search Informative Wavelet-Transformed Values in Conditions of a Partial Restoration of the Initial Data
Voloshko A.V., Lutchyn T.N.
A method of selecting informative coefficients being derived after the wavelet-transform has been proposed for searching a particular value of the entire original data base. For that search the decomposi-tion-tree has been investigated by using that the functional connections were determined between the original and transformed data. Tabl.: 2. Fig.: 6. Refs: 5 titles.
