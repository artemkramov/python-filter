Magnetic Properties of Mesoporous Nanocomposites on the Base of Cobalt
Bagriychuk A.S., Kryuchyn A. A., Kunitskiy Yu. A.
Magnetic properties of mesoporous composites on the cobalt basis are studied within the limits of the micromagnetism theory. Size dependences of coercitivity properties of nanocomposites from the Co nanowires and distance ones between them in mesoporous matrix SiO2 have been obtained. Fig.: 2. Refs: 8 titles.
