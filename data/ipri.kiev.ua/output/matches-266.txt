System Records High-Density Optical Disks
Kosyak I.V.
The analysis and research of optical disc recording systems of high density have been carried out. The features of the development of optical recording disc DVD and Blue-Ray format have been consid-ered. Realization of the control device of semiconductor laser with wavelength of 405 nm for recording formats Blu-Ray, DVD and CD has been suggested. Tabl.: 1. Fig.: 7. Refs: 15 titles.
