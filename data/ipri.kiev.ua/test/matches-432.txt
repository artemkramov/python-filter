Diffraction Control of Optical Discs Microrelief
Antonov E.E., Shyhovets A.V.
Microrelief diffraction characteristics of optical discs with different profile of pits are studied. Calibration diffraction curves for polarized laser light are obtained for the determination of the optical parameters of microrelief. Diffraction properties of multilayer disk structures are calculated, including metalized disc surfaces. Tabl.: 1. Fig.: 11. Refs: 10 titles.
