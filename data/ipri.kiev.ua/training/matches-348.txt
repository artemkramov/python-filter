Studying of Computing Properties of System of Antiquaternions
Turenko A S.
The next step researches on one of non-commutative hypercomplex numerical systems of the fourth dimension as system of antiquaternions are presented. It is constructed the exponent representation of antiquaternion variable by two methods: by using procedure of doubling of Grassmann-Clifford and by the associative system of the linear differential equations. Refs: 7 titles.
