Diffraction Grating for Reducing Chromatism Area of Microprism
Antonov E.E.
Optimal optical properties of diffractive-refractive achromatic microprism devices have been calculated, the structure and surface relief structures of manufactured such microprisms have been analyzed. The distribution of diffracted intensity of laser beam for microprisms have been experimentally investigated. It was stated that ahromatic properties for investigated microprisms are absent due to the relief defects, manifested primarily in different heights of triangular profiles. Fig.: 12. Refs: 6 titles.
