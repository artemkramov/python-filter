Investigation of the electronic structure of nanowires VTM-Au.
Kasiyanenko V.Kh., Akhmetov B.S., Yaremchuk Y.E.
A study of physical-chemical properties of nano-wires TMV-Au has been performed by means of x-ray photo-electronic spectroscopy with angular resolution. It has been revealed that the found hybrid virus-nonorganic constructions give preference to interaction of nano-vires with undercoat through C-N link, while N-C=O link characterizes the binding of wirions to each other.
