Diagnostic Model Synthesis Based on Neuro-Fuzzy Network with High Generalization Prop-erties
Subbotin S.A.
The method of diagnostic model synthesis built around neuro-fuzzy networks with high generali-zation properties has been developed. It identifies and reduces the fuzzy terms, forms and summarizes a set of production rules, based on which in a non-iterative mode it synthesizes a neuro-fuzzy network, which improves the properties of generalization and also simplifies the diagnostic models.
