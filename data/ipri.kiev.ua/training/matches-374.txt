Study of relations between the generalized quaternions and procedure of doubling of hypercomplex numerical systems
Kalinovsky Ya.O., Boyarinova Yu.E., Sukalo A.S.
The class of non-commutative hypercomplex number systems of 4-dimension, constructed by using of non-commutative procedure of Grassman-Clifford doubling of 2-dimensional systems is investigated and established their relations with the generalized quaternions. Algorithms of the operations and methods of algebraic characteristics calculation in them, such as conjugation, normalization and a type of zero dividers have been investigated. Tabl.: 3.
