Criteria Conceived Commutative Hypercomplex Number Systems Direct Sum of Low-Dimensional Systems
Kalinovsky J.А.
It is considered the representativeness criteria of commutative hypercomplex number systems di-rect sum of low-dimensional systems. Those allow construct the efficient algorithms for the classification of hypercomplex number systems. Refs: 9 titles.
