A.A. Nechaev, D.V. Lande
It has been considered the restoration of edges in networks after their removal by destructive influences. The study results for the networks have been obtained by three algorithms: Barabashi-Albert; throwing by the edges; a real network of concepts and information links between them in the Web publications. It has been found that using the algorithm discussed in the real network is restored approximately 50 % bonds, and in artificial networks of such connections is only 25 %. Fig.: 5. Refs: 8 titles.
