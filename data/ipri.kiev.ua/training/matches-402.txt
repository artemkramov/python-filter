Detection of optimal hierarchy in a quasi-hierarchical graph by centrality criteria
Sulema O.K., Lande D.V.
The results of the research dedicated to the extraction of hierarchical sub-networks, being the best in terms of centrality criteria, from quasi-hierarchical networks are presented. Multi-objective estimation methods for detection of a node which is optimal by centrality criterion are discussed. The hierarchy construction algorithms are analysed. Experimental verification of received theoretical results has been performed using a group of quasi-hierarchical graphs. Tabl.: 3. Fig.: 4. Refs: 5 titles.
