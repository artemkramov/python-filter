The analysis of methods of micro- and nanorelief structures recording at chalcogenide vitreous semiconductors films is presented. It is shown that exposing of the chalcogenide vitreous semiconductors films by optical radiation focused by diffraction limited optical systems allows to obtain prints with much smaller size than the diffraction boundary by using of the photosensitive materials exposure characte-ristics nonlinearity. The data of the recording nanosize structures by near field and electron beam systems are revealed. Fig.: 6. Refs: 28 titles.
