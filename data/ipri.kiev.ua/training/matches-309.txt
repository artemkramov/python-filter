Authentication Method of Interaction Parties Based on Reccurent Sequences
Yaremchuk Yu.Е.
It has been suggested a method for authentication of the interaction parties, based on recurrent Vk sequences and their dependencies. An analysis of cryptographic reliability and computational com-plexity shows that the proposed method is more robust in providing, in general, approximately the same computation complexity as the well-known counterparts. An important advantage of the proposed method is that it provides a significant simplification of procedures for authentication testing. Fig.: 1. Refs: 7 titles.
