Estimation of alternative project solutions using the DEA optimization methodology in Excel
Bocharov V.V., Dodonov O.G., Kuzmychov А.I.
In project management, the portfolio is formed by sequential objective selection among a given set of projects as a homogeneous objects, each of which is characterized by a set of identical input and output in the specified measurements, dividing the population into two classes , namely, the leaders and outsiders. Multi-step evaluation process being a subdividing of given set of similar objects with the updated I/O into two independent classes is completed, if necessary, by the definition of a single winner. Methodology DEA, used for such division, is characterized by objectivity evaluation process of func-tional efficiency of objects, because each of them uses its own best ratios of I/O with respect to similar relationships of all objects. Methods of estimating the application based on mathematical optimization tool unit, which is implemented as a software module in Excel and automatically operates as active spreadsheet template.
