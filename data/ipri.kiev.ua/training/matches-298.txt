Binary Trees Approach to Speedup Address Range Lookup in Peer-to-Peer Solutions
G. V. Poryev
It has been analyzed specifics of underlying algorithms for address range lookup. Concerning the storage of IP ranges, the drawbacks and bottlenecks of existing implementations have been determined. A new, faster method based on binary trees for storing and accessing the IP range databases is proposed.
binary trees, distributed networks, peer-to-peer.
