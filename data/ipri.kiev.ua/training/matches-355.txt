Kalinovsky Ya.O., Boyarinova Yu.E., Turenko A.S.
The class of non-commutative hypercomplex number systems (HNS) of 4-dimension constructed by using of non-commutative procedure of Grassman-Clifford doubling of 2-dimensional systems is investigated. All HNS of this class are constructed, algorithms of performance of operations and methods of algebraic characteristics calculation in them, such as conjugation, normalization, a type of zero dividers are researched. The formulas of exponential functions representation are derived for these systems. Refs: 10 titles.
