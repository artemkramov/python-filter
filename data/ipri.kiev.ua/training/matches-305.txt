Identification of Voice Characteristics on the Base of Wavelet Transformation Maximums
Solovyev V.I.
The results of studies on the development of the methodology and mathematical model of detection and analysis of self-similar structures in the utterances of audio files have been demonstrated. The model allows through Morlet wavelet basis to allocate the spatial domain scaling graphs geometric formations with ridge-like structure. It is shown that these structures, under certain conditions, are of the one-to-one correspondence to the individual characteristics of the voice. Fig.: 4. Refs: 26 titles.
