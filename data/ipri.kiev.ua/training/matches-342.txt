The Study of Amorphous Chalcogenide Materials of Memory Elements Based on Phase Transitions
Kyrylenko V.K., Marjan V.M., Durkot M.O., Rubish V.M.
A stand was developed that allows simultaneously measure the temperature dependences of the electrical resistance (R) and optical transmittance (0) of films in the region of temperatures 300-560 K. The temperature dependences of R and 0 amorphous films of antimony-selenium have been studied. It is shown that their crystallization is accompanied by a sharp decrease of these parameters. The temperature range of film transition from amorphous to a crystalline state depends on the film composition, material for contacts and heat treatment conditions. Fig.: 7. Refs: 18 titles.
