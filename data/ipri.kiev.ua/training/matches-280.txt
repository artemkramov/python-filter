The Use of Hyper-Complex Number Systems for Mathematical Modeling of Limit Modes Electrical Systems
Klipkov S.I.
It has been considered restrictions of classical complex variable theory to analyze complex equa-tions for steady-state mode electrical systems due non-analyticity complex power as a function of com-plex voltages. It is shown that the vector components of complex real hyper-complex solutions appear in a subset of the domain of existence of established modes of the confluent complex matrices first approximation, the formation of which uses the notion pseudo-derivative of the. Thus, that significantly simplifies the mathematical modeling of limit modes for electrical systems. Tabl.: 2. Fig.: 1. Refs: 15 titles.
