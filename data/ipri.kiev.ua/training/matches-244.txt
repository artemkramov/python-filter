Construction of High-Dimensional Isomorphic Hypercomplex Number Systems
Boyarinova Yu.E., Gorodko N.A.
Some problems of constructing isomorphic hypercomplex number systems (HNS) with the dimen-sion multiplication operator are considered. Multiplication tables of high-dimensional HNSs and isomor-phism operators are obtained. Refs: 15 titles.
