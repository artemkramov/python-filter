Model and classification of database replication techniques
Wlodzimierz Khadzynov, Mateusz Maksymiuk
Construction of a universal mathematic-logical model of replication pro-cesses in data bases is considered. The fundamental definitions of notions for different types of replication are given. The classification of replication tech-niques is proposed and the respective efficiency criteria are determined. The variants of realization for system architecture, locking strategy, servers interaction, transaction termination, database platforms, correctness criteria of transaction terminator are discussed.
database replication, distributed database, transaction, locking transactions, isolation transactions.
