Mеthodological Aspects of Creating Heightened Survivability Corporative Information Ana-lytical Systems
Dodonov О.G., Kuznyetsova M.G., Gorbachyk O.S.
The main methodological approaches to Heightened Survivability Corporative Information Ana-lytical Systems (CIAS) creation have been considered. The development of methodology on the Surviva-bility theory base is proposed. The possibility of survivability mechanisms’ embedding in CIAS during system construction using the functional profiles has been demonstrated. Refs: 9 titles.
