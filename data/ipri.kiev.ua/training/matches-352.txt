Building of Networks of Natural Hierarchies of Terms Based on Analysis of Texts Corpora
Lande D.V., Snarskii A.A., Putyatin V.G.
The building technique of networks of terms hierarchies being based on the analysis of chosen texts on selected issues (survivability of technical and information systems) is offered. The technique is based on the methodology of horizontal visibility graphs for individual words, bigrams and trigrams. It has been constructed and investigated a language network, formed on the basis of full texts of scientific papers on the issue of survivability. Tabl.: 1. Fig.: 5. Refs: 9 titles.
