Petrov V.V., Kryuchyn A.A., Antonov E.E., Tokalin О.О., Shanoіlo S.M.
The calculations of optical parameters of ophthalmic microprism symmetric structures consisting of two identical microprism elements have been performed. A comparative analysis of chromatic effects for optical compensators with single micro-prism and symmetric compensators has been fulfilled. The influence of parameters of compensators on visual acuity, exposing the patient the diagnosis of view for different types of compensators has been investigated. A method of creating the attenuators for ophthalmic applications based microrelief structures of the profile is proposed. Fig.: 7. Refs: 10 titles.
