Elements of Combinatorial Approach in Determining the Consistency Spectral Coefficient of Experts’ Pairwise Comparisons
Tsyganok V.V.
The spectral approach is one of the most theoretically proven approaches to determining the con-sistency of a set of expert paired comparisons with support decision making in weakly structured do-mains. In order to improve the reliability determination of the consistency spectral coefficient for matrices of paired comparisons, a more complete usage of the information contained in the matrix, using the elements of a combinatorial approach to the formation of the components of the spectra is proposed. Applying this approach avoids unnecessary references to experts during organizing feedback to achieve a sufficient level of consistency. Tabl.: 3. Fig.: 3. Refs: 10 titles.
