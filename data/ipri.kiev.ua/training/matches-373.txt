Fractal method of forming etalon images in vision systems
Yuzefovich V.V., Butochnov A N., Mezentsev A.V., Mironyuk S.V.
Based on the analysis of existing methods of image processing in vision systems, there is proposed to use a fractal method for forming etalon images as the most appropriate by criterion of computational feasibility. Fig.: 5. Refs: 10 titles.
