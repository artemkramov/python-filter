Kalynovskyi J.A., Boyarinova J.Е., Sukalo A.S.
The algebraic and functional properties of generalized commutative and non-commutative hypercomplex numerical systems, the fourth dimension, obtained by doubling the Grassmann-Clifford procedure are investigated. The expressions for the rules, interfaces and performances of exponential functions have been found. Refs: 10 titles.
