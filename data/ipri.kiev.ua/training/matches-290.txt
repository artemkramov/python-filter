Hypercomplex Parametric Numerical System in the Mathematical Modeling
Klipkov S.I.
The properties of numerical systems of the second rank over the field of complex numbers, which are elements of the set described by a generalized parametric system of hypercomplex numbers, have been considered. It is shown that the quadroplex numbers and quaternions are special cases of this parametric system of hypercomplex numbers. Tabl.: 2. Refs: 3 titles.
hypercomplex numerical system, quadroplex numbers, quaternions, elements of the inverse, zero divisors, commutativity, associativity.
