A Quality Estimate of Magnetic Media Data Layer
Beliak Ie.V., Kozhan T.M., Kryuchin A.A.
A modern techinque for quality estimate of magnetic media data layer of all patterns, which is founded on use of digital processing of multivariate signals principles, is considered. The block diagrams for the techinque practical realization are developed. Fig.: 3. Refs.: 3 titles.
