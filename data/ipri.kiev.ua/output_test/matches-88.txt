Structural Image Recognition on the Basis of Models of Attributes Voting of Characteristic Points
Gorohovatsky V.A., Putyatin E.P.
Questions of intellectual information processing in computer vision systems are considered. Meth-ods of structural image recognition based on the voting models are investigated. Formalization of the recognition problem is performed, approaches for construction of hierarchical decisions and a function of conformity to a class are offered, results of computer modeling are discussed. Tabl.: 1. Fig. 3, Refs: 10 titles.
