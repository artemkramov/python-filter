Technology of the Luminescent Identification Elements recording on the Optical Disc Surface
Belуak Е.V.
An efficiency of the complex copy protection methods has been analyzed. Possibility of the lumi-nescent protective elements recording on the optical disc cover and work surface has been considered. Pyrazoline composite dyes with high luminescence quantum yield and photosensitivity values were syn-thesized. RGB-matrix of the luminescent image, barcode and corrupted sectors laser recording scheme was proposed. Tabl.: 1. Fig.: 4. Refs: 4 titles.
