The analytical methods used for solving tasks of optical thin-film and nanostructure materials sci-ence are considered. Examples of application of the most widespread and informative methods of the analysis are given. For the most frequently used methods the basic artifacts of the analysis and methods of their elimination or the account at the analysis of results are presented. Tabl.: 7. Fig.: 3. Refs: 27 titles.
