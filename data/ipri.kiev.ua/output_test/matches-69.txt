An analysis of optical characteristics of Fresnel microprism elements is conducted. The features of manufacturing technology and methods of utilizing such elements in ophthalmology are investigated. Diagnostic method for optical surfaces quality by diffraction phenomena is proposed. The method of measurement the value of concomitant strabismus by modified Fresnel prisms is developed. Fig.: 8.
