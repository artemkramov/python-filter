Kosyak I.V.
Improvement of a measuring system of a laser-beam recorder positioner drive with the purpose of increasing the precision of its movement is presented. Realization of the given measuring system on the basis of a sine-cosine interpolator by using multiplying digital-analog converters is proposed. Fig.: 1. Refs.: 3 titles.
