The Influence of Laser and Thermal Annealing on Magnetoimpedance Effect in Co59Fe5Ni10Si11B15 Nanocrystalline Alloy
Kravets V.G., Poperenko L.V., Manko D.Y.
Magnetoimpedance effect enhancement via thermal and laser treatments of Co59Fe5Ni10Si11B15 amorphous alloy is investigated. Magnetooptical measurements have shown irreversible changes in the skin-layers of a ribbon and its magnetic properties as a result of thermal and laser treatments. Auger spectroscopy data shows enrichment of amorphous alloy surface by metal-metal and metal-metaloid clusters due to such treatments. Electronic microscopy results have persuaded essential distinguish in nanogranules size in amorphous ribbons after laser and thermal annealing. Fig.: 5. Refs.: 15 titles.
