The Using of Methods for Accelerated Ageing of the Optical Media for Estimating their Life Expectancy
Gorbov I.V.
Stress conditions for accelerated ageing of optical media and changing of their properties during ar-tificial ageing are analyzed. A possibility of estimating data life expectancy of optical media and deter-mining a period of time, after which a stored information must be recopied, is shown. Tabl.: 2. Fig.: 7. Refs.: 8 titles.
