The approach to providing security of information in computer systems and networks based on chaotic systems is considered. The open key cryptography system, which functions as a chaotic dynamic system, is proposed. It is shown that the most effective method of a cryptanalysis of the offered system is based on a solution of the inverse task of chaotic dynamics and has exponential dependence of complexity on a key length.
