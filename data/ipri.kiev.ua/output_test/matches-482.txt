Fractal Properties of theМatic Information Streams from the Internet
Lande, D.V.
Fractal properties of information streams from the Internet are examined. As a database for computing experiment, the network news monitoring system InfoStream is chosen. The technique of calculation of Hurst’s parameters for thematic cluster and qualitative interpretation of results are presented. Fig.: 4. Refs.: 6 titles.
