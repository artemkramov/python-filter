Modeling of Avalanche Formation Process
Kuzemin A.Ya., Fastova D.V., Dyachenko O.N.
Actual questions of catastrophe forecasting, in particular avalanche forecasting are considered. Avalanche formation model construction is the main task for making qualitative forecast. Existing modeling methods are analyzed and their disadvantages are elicited. Group Method of Data Handling for construction of avalanche formation process model is proposed. Fig.: 1. Refs: 8 titles.
