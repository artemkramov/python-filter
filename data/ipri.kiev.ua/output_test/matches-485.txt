Relative Ð¡riterion Weight Calculation Based on Ordinal Estimates
Kadenko S.V.
Relative criterion weight calculation method based on ordinal estimates is considered. The dis-cussed method is an iteration one similar to neuronal network learning methods. Problem statement, de-scription of each algorithm step and results of its testing, as well as examples and tables illustrating the work of the specified method are proposed. Tabl.: 5. Fig.: 6.
