Technology of Simulation of Production Processes with the Sequential Organization
Klimenko A.V.
The way of formalization of production processes with the sequential organization at presence of probabilistic characteristics of technological operations and an opportunity of occurrence of failures of the equipment is considered. The approach to research of production processes on the basis of application of the Monte-Carlo method, semimarkovian processes and procedures of the analysis of operational conditions is described. The structure and technology of the use of simulation automatization means for investigated objects are given. Fig.: 1. Refs: 6 titles.
