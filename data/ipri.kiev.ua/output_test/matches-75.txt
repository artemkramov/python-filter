Butochnov A.N., Ostashevsky V.B., Tsytsarev V.N.
The approximate strategy based on approach for calculation of reliability characteristics of hardware complex using adequacy characteristics of reserve set is offered. Reliability characteristics of hardware complex can be obtained through multiplying reliability characteristics calculated for unlimited reserve set by corresponding adequacy characteristics of reserve set.
