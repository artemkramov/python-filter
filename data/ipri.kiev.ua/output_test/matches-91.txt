False Conformity Filtration of Key Points Descriptors on the Basis of Geometrical Data Analysis
Gorohovatsky V.A.
Questions of structural approaches improvement at the data analysis in systems of computer vision are considered. Filtration methods on the basis of the spatial information as a way of false attributes elimination are investigated. Formalization of a problem is carried out, approaches for clusterisation in the space of geometrical transformations are suggested, results of computer modeling are discussed. Fig.: 2.
