LSF-Vocoder Based on the Vector Quantization
Tkachenko О.M., Bilichenko N.О., Feferman O.D., Khruschak S.V.
LSF vocoder model with vector parameters quantization is investigated. Different methods of LSF vector division using spectral distortion measure of a coded signal are compared. Tabl.: 2. Fig.: 2. Refs.: 7 titles.
