A high-priority topic of the risk management in emergency situations is considered. The situational model which makes possible to increase a management efficiency risk of emergency avalanche situa-tions is proposed. The model represents decomposition of avalanche and nonavalanche situations on a set of microsituations. Wilcoxon criterion as a microsituations similarity measure is used. Tabl.: 5. Fig.: 4.
