Block Convolutional Codes in Integrity Check Tasks
Mаtоv О.Y., Vаsylenko V.S.
The task of construction of block convolutional code with the use of encoding–decoding algorithms, which are inherent to the classic noise-combating, correcting convolutional code which would be able to provide the detection and correction of double distortions, is considered. Fig.: 5. Refs: 4 titles.
