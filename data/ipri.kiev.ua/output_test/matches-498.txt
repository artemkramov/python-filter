Analysis of Plasmon Influence on the Transmission Efficiency of Near-Field Elements of Su-perdense Optical Information Recording Systems
Goldayevich E.E.
The theory of surface plasmons origin in air–metal–dielectric interfaces radiated by incident light of visible spectrum is considered. A possibility of plasmon resonance near-field enhancement is theoretically shown. Examples of near-field optical recording elements having enhanced resolution because of surface plasmons influence are given. Fig.: 6. Refs: 6 titles.
