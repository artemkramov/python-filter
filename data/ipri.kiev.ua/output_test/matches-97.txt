Optimization of Visible Information Receiving and Processing
Pilkevych I.A.
To increase processing efficiency of the visible information received through the space sounding of Earth it is suggested to apply the optimal radar signal weight processing. A circuit design of the selfbalancing potentiometer, the basic element of which is spatial-velocity model of a body-distributed object is developed. The efficiency evaluation of the developed spatial-temporal self- balancing potentiometer is carried out. Fig.: 3. Refs: 12 titles.
