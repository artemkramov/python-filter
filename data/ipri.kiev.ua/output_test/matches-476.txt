Lipinsky A.Y., Rudyakova A.N., Danilov V.V.
The design of acoustooptical digital processors requires the using of numerical solution methods, which allow to take into account the finite aperture of acoustooptic cell. The modeling of weak acous-tooptic interaction by vector finite elements time-domain method is presented. Fig.: 10. Refs: 16 titles.
