Canadian sociology in the global village
A. Rezaev, G. Sandstrom
<p>The paper addresses questions concerning the place and role of Canadian sociology in the larger global context. In what ways can&nbsp;Canadian sociology complementglobal sociology? What challenges face Canadian sociology in universities today? The authors review&nbsp;trajectories and paradigms of Canadian sociology, its history, and recent developments. The institutional structures of Canadian&nbsp;sociology are observed in the framework of 'sociology as a scientific and academic discipline' (SaSAD). The article provides a brief&nbsp;historical account to the Anglo/French division in Canadian sociology, examines its relationship with the country's legacy and complex&nbsp;interplay between social movements, political parties and social science. The case of Canada helps to address principal questions&nbsp;concerning the place of sociology as a scientific and academic discipline in the contemporary university.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Social Science; Academic Discipline; Sociology in Canada; Global Sociology; Historical and Comparative Analysis
