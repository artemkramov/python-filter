Transition from the Shah to Shiite Theocracy, and the Rise of the Pasdaran as a political, military and economic institution
C. Weston
<p>The aim of the paper is to examine the evolution of the Pasdaran (Sepah-e Pasdaran-e Enqelab-e Eslami or the "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps" but hereinafter referred to as "the Pasdaran") through its various guises as a military-economic-political institution arising from the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The analysis will incorporate the Conceptual Framework of Limited Access Order, as set out by Douglass North &amp; others, and will examine the social and historic context in which the Pasdaran participated by reference to the primary social bodies that existed at the time of the Islamic Revolution and their bearing on the development of the Pasdaran as it acquired other characteristics above and beyond its military status. The Pasdaran has achieved an almost unique social-political-economic-military role in Iranian society as it has used its position to secure and maintain the extraction of rents that have placed it in a class of its own and defy meaningful comparison with other real world examples. It is estimated that the Pasdaran controls between 25-40% of Iran's GDP and controls 21% of the Tehran Stock Exchange's market value in sectors such as oil, petrochemicals, telecommunications, construction, mining and metals. Its proximity to the Supreme Leader and its presence in the Majles parliament also enables it to influence the course of Iranєs political development for securing its wealth.</p>&nbsp;</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Iran; The Pasdaran; Institutions; Douglass North; Limited Access Order.
