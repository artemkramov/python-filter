Feminization of poverty: the Nigerian account
E. Nwaoduh
<p>The paper is an attempt at contributing to the on-going debate on feminization of poverty by discussing the concept of feminization&nbsp;poverty in Nigeria. Women in Nigeria cannot be seen as a minority group and anything (as poverty is the case here) that is a challenges&nbsp;to them as a group should not be neglected as it has and will continue to have tremendous negative effects on the development of the&nbsp;country. Prior to this time, many poverty alleviation programs which are highlighted in the work have been initiated by several&nbsp;governments and they achieved some successes although to a larger extent due to poor implementation and corruption they failed as is&nbsp;evident in the level of poverty in Nigeria. The research elucidates the causes, effects and consequences of women's poverty in Nigeria.&nbsp;Some of the causes discussed include limited access to resources that help women escape from poverty; low income and work&nbsp;discrimination; lack of access to good health care services and socio-cultural exclusions. While some of the effects include poor health&nbsp;and health care access; inadequate food and poor nutrition; lack or poor quality of education; limited access to information and&nbsp;technological development. Several remedies such as increasing the productive capacity of women through access to Economic&nbsp;resources, information and technical assistance, which will increase their income and improve nutrition, education, health care and&nbsp;status within the household were also brought into perspective. Recommendations were made to all concerned groups- the women,&nbsp;men and government agencies and apparatuses, one of which includes: the availability of skill acquisition programs, which should be<br>free and accessible for women especially those in the rural area should be organised, by the government, non-governmental agencies,&nbsp;and well-meaning philanthropists. It was concluded that the structure of the Nigeria society gives room for female poverty.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Feminization; poverty; Feminization of poverty; gender; patriarchy; discrimination
