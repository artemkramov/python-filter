Moving out of "Their Places": Migration into Australia
О. Oleinikova
<p>Using а combination of migration literature analysis and practical experiences of Ukrainian migrants in Australia this paper&nbsp;examines the character of post-independence Ukrainian migration to Australia. Through comparative analysis of Ukrainian immigration&nbsp;waves to Australia, the paper looks back to origins of such immigration, briefly reflecting on the history of Ukrainian arrivals, and<br>explains trends in current immigration movement. Particularly, using interview materials with Ukrainian migrants who came to Australia&nbsp;in the post-independence period (from 1991 until 2013) this paper identifies the main immigration streams popular among Ukrainians&nbsp;that form three groups of migrants: economic migrants "zarobitchany", tourist-visa over stayers (from illegal migrants to refugees) and&nbsp;high skilled migrants. The focus is on the logic of the post-Soviet immigration wave, which is formed and explained not only by socioeconomic&nbsp;rationale behind migration, but also by relations inside Ukrainian community, which have significantly changed since the&nbsp;collapse of the Soviet Union. Complex relations between post-war Ukrainian migrants and their Australian descendants on one hand,&nbsp;and post-independence Ukrainian migrants on the other, is argued to be rooted in the difference in qualitative characteristics and&nbsp;historical conditions, rather than in simple withstanding of political versus economic migration waves.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>post-independence Ukrainian migration; Australia; types of migrants; Ukrainian community; political migrants; economic migrants
