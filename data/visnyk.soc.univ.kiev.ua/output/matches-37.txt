On the problem of metaparadigmatic typologization of sociological knowledge
А. Melnikov
<p><em><strong><br></strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The paper examines the problem of pluralism in modern paradigmatic conceptualizations of sociological knowledge. The notion of polyparadigmality, main typologies of paradigms, and attempts of their meta-theoretic generalizations are considered. In this context, most attention paid to the existential paradigm as one of the most relevant approaches to the understanding of current social changes. Based on theoretical and historical perspectives, author proposes a structured typology that includes classical, nonclassical and postnonclassical metaparadigms, each of which, in turn, involves certain paradigms. It is shown that the change of meta-paradigms primarily revealed the increase of sociological self-reflection and the adoption of dialectical logic of objectivism, subjectivism and their subsequent synthesis. There is questioning the very necessity of epistemological application of paradigm and meta-paradigm levels, which can be reduced in scale to theories and paradigms accordingly. Main directions of further meta-systematization of sociological knowledge from a perspective of "theoretical minimalism" is outlined. This perspective's methodological strategy described as rooted in the method of the history of sociology, suggesting strict fixation and comprehensive interrelation of constant, essential elements of paradigms. The problem of meta-systematization has also included the differentiation of explicit and implicit divisions of theory comparison, sociological and social criteria of paradigmatic typology, multidimensional model of theoretical dichotomies, and conceptualization of interdisciplinary connections of meta-paradigms (positivism, existentialism, postmodernism, functionalism, etc.).</strong></em></p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Paradigm, meta-paradigm, polyparadigmality, theoretical minimalism, history of sociology, existential paradigm.
