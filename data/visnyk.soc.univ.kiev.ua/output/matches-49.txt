Globalization and its Minacious Effects on Indian Education System: A Critical Analysis
K. Ch. Mandal
<p>Indian education system, the second largest system in the world, is at the crossroad now. Since the pre-Independence period the system has been facing various challenges, which has not finished yet. After six decades of freedom India could not free its education from narrow political interference. Though it has progressed a lot, still a lot of problems are standing on the way of universalization of primary education. Higher education is also under the control of political bosses, many of whom have not crossed the boundary of college. This has aggravated the quality of education. Globalization has engulfed the students astoundingly. Easily available mobile phones, internet, computer and western music, fashion etc. have created immeasurable losses to millions of students. Mass-copying in examination halls, movements in the campuses, slapping and abusing the teachers, confining the principals and vice-chancellors for more than fifty hours, manhandling them in their offices and campuses, ransacking college and university properties, processions and shouting slogans in the campuses have become common phenomena. Watching video clips, chatting on phones during and off periods have become fashion. Smoking, drinking and enjoying the campus life through other means have been a trend in most of the Indian universities. Discipline and mutual respected have been vanished from the campuses. This prompted this researcher to find out the nature and extent of problems and finding the ways out for making India one of the best and developed countries in the world.</p><p>The study is mainly historical and partly empirical. It is based on the secondary source of data as well as primary. It has been found that globalization and political interference and party-influenced student politics are the main causes of deterioration of the Indian education system. But the challenges posed by globalization and narrow politics could be aptly and efficiently handled by only morally sound, spiritually upright, highly educated, honest and truly good political and academic decision makers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Globalization; education; Americanization; Westernization; fashion; universities.
