Agent-cultural model of radicalization of immigrants milieus in the west
O. Kutsenko, L. Berlyand, A. Gorbachyk
<p>The project deals with exploration of the heuristic utility of the Agent-Cultural sociological model of radicalization of migrant social&nbsp;milieus in the West (ACSMR). The interpretation of radicalization is based on the research finding by M. Sageman concerning the four&nbsp;phases in critical changing in individual beliefs, feelings and behaviors. The radicalization is conceptualized as a non-linear networked&nbsp;social process of self-organization in large-scale social milieus on the bases of critical transition in beliefs and attitudes, which lead to a&nbsp;formation of radical social networks. The ACSMR was developed by the authors to monitor and predict the development over time of&nbsp;social milieus of the religious-concerned immigrants towards support of political violence. It is a statistical model based on the analysis&nbsp;of correlation-covariation of variables. For a reduction of the complexity of the dynamic structural properties of radicalised groups&nbsp;(including terroristic ones), the authors define compactly factors (which support the radicalization) and the critical conditions for&nbsp;transition of the social milieu to the radical state.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>radicalization; immigrant milieus; complexity; self-organization; Agent-Cultural Model of radicalization
