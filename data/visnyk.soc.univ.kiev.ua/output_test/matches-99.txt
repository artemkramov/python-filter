Trends and Contradictions in Institutionalization of Activities of Participants of Labor Relations in Contemporary Ukraine
The article aims to answer the question of why institutionalization of labor relations is not meeting popular expectations in Ukraine akin to other post-Soviet countries. It uses social dialogue as a telling example. In the 1990s Ukrainian society underwent a multidimensional process of formation of labor relations. On the one hand, the process was characteristic of early stages of capitalism, and thus could have been hardly expected to lead to the emergence of a social market economy, while on the other hand it featured the worst traditions of socialist labor relations, the only change being the substitution of patron-client relationship for state paternalism. Establishment of institutional market infrastructure was supported by social partners' organizations and legitimized by legislation. A system of market relations has been created, but proved incapable of performing functions that were essential for sustaining standards and values of economic democracy. 'Social partnership' as an ideology of labor relations was replaced with a new form â€“ 'social dialogue'. Social dialogue has degenerated to a simulation of contemporary labor relations. Formalization of social dialogue has become a way for proto-oligarchic organizations of social partners to gradually monopolize the market. The process was accompanied by passive acceptance from dependent, poorly organized and unprotected employees.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>social market economy; social dialogue; patron-client relationship; state paternalism
