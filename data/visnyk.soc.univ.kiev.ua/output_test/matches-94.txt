From Functional Theory of Conflict to the Issue of Linguistic Construction of Social Conflict
O. Danylenko
The author proposes to develop a "matrix" of functions of the language of conflict (based on Coser's functions of conflict) which can be applied, for example, in analysis of texts of interviews which contain characteristics of the language of conflict. By means of this, functions of the conflict and functions of the language of conflict can be considered with regard to different systems and subsystems of social conflicts, including linguistically constructed conflicts as a subsystem of realistic conflicts.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>social conflict; functions of conflict; language of conflict; linguistic-conflictological approach; linguistic construction of social conflict; realistic and unrealistic conflicts; functions of the language of conflict.
