The Contradictions of the Concepts of Social Exclusion and Inclusion: the Impact of Socio-Political Discourse on Sociological Theory
Yu. Savelyev
The article analyzes the concepts of social exclusion and social inclusion and identifies their contradictions. On the basis of publica-tions of H.Silver, R.Levitas, A.Sen and others it is argued that a separate line of elaboration of these concepts has developed within European social policy discourse which was influenced by the following ideologies: communitarian-republican, liberal-integrationist, social-redistributionist. It is asserted that all these ideologies share the understanding of social exclusion as relative, relational, and multidimensional deprivation, while social inclusion is regarded as a compensation of deprivation and repair of social bonds. Such understanding is not compatible with a widespread notion in contemporary sociology that in post-modern societies the importance of hierarchical inequalities has been replaced with horizontal differentiation. Existing approaches to social inclusion are featured, and their heuristic advantages and limitations are demonstrated.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>social inclusion; social exclusion; modern society; relative deprivation; relational capability deprivation
