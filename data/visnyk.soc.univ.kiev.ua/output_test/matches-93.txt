Sequence of Transition from Sociolinguistics to Sociology of Language: Reflection of Socio-Group Structure of Society in the Social Structure of Language
L. Nikolaenko
The article discusses the issues posed by the logic of transition from the sociolinguistics to the sociology of language, which was caused by a combination of trends peculiar to contemporary capitalist, and, respectively, unstable societies. The main trend is increasing social differentiation of traditional languages, which is accompanied by their рidginization and creolization, language conflicts, tabooisation of word usage by means of language reform, etc. All of these, in the author's opinion, urge sociologists to devote much more attention to the issues of sociology of language.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>sociolinguistics; sociology оf language; social structure of language; language conflicts
