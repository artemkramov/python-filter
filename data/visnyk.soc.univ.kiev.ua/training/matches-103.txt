On interpretation of the term "paradata" in social research
M. Sydorov
<em><strong>The use of computer technology in the planning, programming sociological research, data collection and analysis allowed more effectively analyze large amounts of information. Mainly in information obtained from sociological studies imply a data set consisting of questions and answers of the respondents. In computer mediated data collection during social studies increases the possibility of automatic recording and accompanying accumulation of information, some of which can be used to improve the quality of the survey results. In the literature, a number of terms that describe the information obtained during the investigation. It includes research data, metadata paradata, auxiliary data and additional data. Each of these data types have to have their interpretation and meaning and take their place in the data hierarchy. Thus, the data – is the answers of respondents to a questionnaire, metadata – this is the formulation of questions and alternatives and supporting documentation on research, paradata – information about the process of generating or receiving data, auxiliary data as construct with higher level contains paradata and other information. This paper is an overview and background of the term "paradata" firstly introduced by Mick Couper in 1998, justified its interpretation and content of this concept is illustrated by examples.</strong></em></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>data, metadata paradata
