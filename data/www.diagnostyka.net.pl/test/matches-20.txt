The article presents research related to the rollers construction modification from N-type into C type in the belt conveyor Gwarek 1200 type and the ensuing drop in power consumption measured in the drive unit. The study was conducted in a coal mine at 600 m level of depth. The study also included resistance measurements of static and dynamic rotating rollers in a laboratory stand own construction according to PN-M-46606 standard. The article also presents economic analysis of the C type rollers used instead of N type rollers and profitability analysis basing on 1 ton of coal transport.
