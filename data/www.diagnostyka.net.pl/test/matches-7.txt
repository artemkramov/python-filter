In this paper, the author analyzed an applicability of selected types of time-frequency distributions that belong to Cohen’s class and their reassignments for signals similar to those obtained during machinery diagnostics. At the first step of performed studies a synthetic multicomponent signal that contains both stationary and non-stationary components was analyzed using algorithms based on various time-frequency distributions. This allows for evaluating effectiveness of identification of particular components by applied time-frequency distributions and selecting a group of the most effective algorithms. At the second step, the selected time-frequency distributions were applied for analysis of signals acquired during diagnosis of rolling bearings in order to verify the effectiveness of identification of components responsible for a priori known faults occurred in bearings.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Andrzej-Katunin/37154">Andrzej Katunin</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:andrzej.katunin@polsl.pl"><div></div></a><div>Silesian University of Technology, Konarskiego 18A, 44-100 Gliwice, Polska
