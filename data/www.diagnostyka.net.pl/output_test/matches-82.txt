The need for continuous improvement of product quality, reliability and safety arises and above all a company’s desire to improve its market position and customer satisfaction. These issues require product manufacturers to perform risk analyses that identify and minimize part/system failures throughout the product‘s life cycle. The FMEA methodology is one of the risk analysis techniques recommended by international standards. It is a systematic process to identify potential failures to fulfil the intended function, to identify possible failure causes so the causes can be eliminated, and to locate the failure consequences so the con-sequences can be reduced. In an FMEA, occurrence is a ranking number associated with the likelihood that the failure mode and its associated cause will be present in the item being analysed.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Jana-Galliková/42013">Jana Galliková</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jana.gallikova@fstroj.uniza.sk"><div></div></a><div>University of Žilina, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Univerzitná 1, 010026 Žilina, Slovak Republic
