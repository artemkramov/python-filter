This paper presents a universal stand to diagnose air gear models made in the process of Rapid Prototyping (RP) at the production stage. The stand is designed in an open system, powered by a three-phase electric motor with a power of 0.75 kW, whose speed is controlled by a single-phase inverter. The stand is equipped with two measuring shafts, connected directly to a recorder RMC that allow you to read values torque and rpm in real time. Between this measuring shafts installed a gear reducer to allow the exchange of tested pair of gears. Powder br ake with variable speed control is installed on the output as a load. Responsible for data acquisition software is copyright RMC-M - Monitor, which allows you to preview the results of measurements and print them in a report. Trials conducted on the universal test stand for air gears demonstrators give reproducible, stable work parameters and thus enable to obtain uninterrupted, accurate measurements.
