The article presents a new method for the evaluation of the braking process through analysis of the braking vibration during braking to stop with a permanent the analysis of temporal signals of vibration acceleration in the frequency domain. The problem of research assembled in the article was determined by estimating the braking process one value of the diagnostic parameter of the vibration signal generated by the disc braking level set during braking.
