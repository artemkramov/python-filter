The present paper deals mainly with the improvement of the degradation indicators of a gas turbine. Therefore, to achieve this purpose a prognostic approach is used in order to provide an adequate diagnostic function of the studied gas turbine. In this context, this paper proposes a degradation modeling of the studied gas turbine system in order to increase its safety and to ensure accurate future decision making process that allow to enhance the operating state of this industrial equipment. Indeed, the prognostic system proposed in this work takes into account the eventual vibration impacts over all phases of the life cycle process of the studied system to provide a diagnostic function with the required availability at with lowest maintenance cost.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Ahmed-Hafaifa/45841">Ahmed Hafaifa</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hafaifa@hotmail.com"><div></div></a><div>Applied Automation and Industrial Diagnostics Laboratory, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Djelfa, Djelfa 17000 DZ, Algeria., 17000 Dz Djelfa, Algeria
