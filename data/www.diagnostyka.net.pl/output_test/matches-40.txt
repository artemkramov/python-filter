Raman scattering utilization for distributed temperature measurement in optical fibres
Concept of fibre spontaneous Raman scattering utilizing for distributed temperature sensing is presented. Chosen approach uses both backscattered Stokes as reference and anti-Stokes as detection signals. The analysis is carried out towards Stokes and anti-Stokes bands temperature dependence. In order to achieve best measurement accuracy influence of maximum modulation frequency on spatial resolution is verified. Analysed technique allows to calculate temperature along the fibre with 5 m space precision and 1째C temperature precision. Simulations involve 200 m standard single mode fibre in temperatures in range &lt; -5째C , 60 째C&gt; with 2x1100 m reference fibremaintained in 22째C.
