The aim of this study was to develop a non-invasive method for analyzing the technical condition of wheel rims in slow-moving vehicles. A vibration spectrum analysis was carried out in the frequency domain of wheel rims which were subjected to vibrations within a given range of parameters. Free vibration frequency and decrement in damping were determined to evaluate the rigidity and damping of the examined wheel rims. Those parameters were applied to evaluate weld joints, detect fatigue cracks and structural damage to the analyzed wheel rims. The proposed method can be used to inspect both brand new and used wheel rims in passenger cars, special purpose vehicles and slow moving vehicles. The developed method is non-invasive, and it does not cause damage to the tested object. The time required to perform measurement is will depend on the size of the wheel rim, but it should not exceed 20 seconds.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Arkadiusz-Rychlik/36308">Arkadiusz Rychlik</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rychter@uwm.edu.pl"><div></div></a><div>Katedra Budowy, Eksploatacji Pojazdów i Maszyn, WNT, UWM w Olsztynie, Oczapowskiego 11, 10-719 Olsztyn, Polska
