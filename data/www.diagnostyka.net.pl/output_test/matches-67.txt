Loads acting on the conveyor belt cause it to undergo a continuous process of wear and tear. One of many symptoms indicating such wear and tear is the abrasion of the carrying cover and the pulley cover. Decrements in the belt’s cross-section reduce its puncture resistance, thus increasing the risk of core damage. Early detection of even the slightest damage to belt covers and the evaluation of damage increment may help the user to prepare a more precise schedule of current repairs. Such precision will in turn help to minimize losses due to belt conveyor emergency downtime. This article presents a device for measuring conveyor belt thickness and for evaluating the changes in the belt’s transverse and longitudinal profile. The measurements are performed continuously, along the belt axis. Belt thickness is. The measurement device is managed by an application called DiagBeltSonic, specially designed for this purpose. The application allows the user to define some basic information about the conveyor prior to the test. The measurement results show a sectional view of the belt along the length of the complete loop and also show the longitudinal and transverse profile of the tested belt.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Agata-Kirjanów/29963">Agata Kirjanów</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:agata.kirjanow@pwr.edu.pl"><div></div></a><div>Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Na Grobli 15, 50-421 Wrocław, Polska
