Free vibration method for technical condition assessment of automotive shock absorbers
75536-17644?filename=Free vibration method for
The article provides a discussion on oscillatory methods used for technical condition assessment of shock absorbers in automotive vehicles, focusing primarily on free vibration methods. It comments on results of simulation studies of a simple two-mass model conducted by application of a pulse input function. Results of experimental tests have also been provided in the paper. The foregoing tests consisted in recording of accelerations of the body of an automotive vehicle equipped with a shock absorber enabling simulation of shock absorbing liquid leakage. The follow-up analyses were conducted to establish the decrement of damping as well as the damping coefficient.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Łukasz-Konieczny/63025">Łukasz Jan Konieczny</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:lukasz.konieczny@polsl.pl"><div></div></a><div>Wydział Transportu, Politechnika Śląska, ul.
