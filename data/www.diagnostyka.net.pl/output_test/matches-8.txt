In this article is analyzed the possible mechanism of cavitation bubbles erosive impact on the working surfaces of equipment. The volume and the size of vapor-gas phase generated in hydrodynamic type mode was theoretically determined and experimentally verified. Here are presented the results of studies of cavitation-erosion resistance of food steel, in particular, that the process of destruction has cyclical pattern.
