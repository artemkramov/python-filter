Rubber and magnetorheological fluid applied as the interlayer in composite armours against high-velocity loadings
Monolithic, homogenous ballistic shields consisting of a single thick, high-hardness and high-strength steel plate are rarely applied in modern combat vehicles. Currently, a popular armour concept is a multi-layered shield since it is expected that the kinetic energy of a threat may be dissipated by transmission through materials with different properties and also by multiple interface reflections. Searching for a maximum ballistic protection at minimum weight inspires applications of various materials which complementary behaviour provides a high protective efficiency without excessive mass. The preliminary experimental investigation presented in the paper aimed to verify behaviour of two prototyped laminated armours under impacts of small-calibre projectiles (cal. 7.62). The main interest lied in impact properties of materials proposed as the intermediate layer. The first tested concept was a laminated steel armour with the 10 mm thick rubber interlayer. In the second armour, the intermediate layer consisted of a magnetorheological fluid.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Teresa-Fras/64962">Teresa Fras</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:teresa.frs@gmail.com"><div></div></a><div>ISL - French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, 5 rue du Général Cassagnou, 68300 Saint-Louis, France
