Diagnostics of potential incompatibilities in aeronautical data and information chain
The influence of potentially erroneous, incomplete or inaccessible aeronautical data and information on the occurrence of an accident or serious incident in air traffic and transport is enormous. Those data and information quality has a direct impact on flight operations’ safety. Moreover, much of the information provided, is the basis for planning and safe conduct of the flight and is used to achieve safety, regularity and efficiency of Air Traffic Management, so they must always be up to date and ready to use. In this paper the aeronautical data chain, described in one of the Eurocontrol specifications, was analysed. Then a proceeding diagram, compliant with holding true requirements, was elaborated, pointing out its weaknesses in terms of diagnosis of potential non-compliance that may occur during data request, origination, evaluation, preparation, distribution as well as its end use. In order to facilitate the detection of potential errors, diagnostics of potential incompatibilities’ effects and causes the risk analysis using FMEA method was conducted, giving as an output a rating of non-compliance importance based on the risk priority number (RPN).</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Ewa-Dudek/57998">Ewa Dudek</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:edudek@wt.pw.edu.pl"><div></div></a><div>Politechnika Warszawska, Wydział Transportu, Koszykowa 75, 00-662 Warszawa, Polska
