The pipelines are subject to various constraints variable in time. Those vibrations may result in both the fatigue damage in the pipeline profile at high stress concentration and the damage to the pipeline supports. If the constraint forces are known, the system response may be determined with high accuracy using analytical or numerical methods. In most cases, it may be difficult to determine the constraint parameters, since the industrial pipeline vibrations are due to the dynamic effects of the medium in the pipeline. In that case, a vibration analysis is a suitable alternative method to determine the stress strain state in the pipeline profile. If a straight pipe section supported on both ends is excited by the bending moments in the support profile, the starting point for the stress analysis are the strains, determined from the Euler–Bernoulli equation. In practice, it is easier to determine the displacement using the experimental methods, since the factors causing vibrations are unknown. The industrial system pipelines, unlike the transfer pipelines, are straight sections at some points only, which makes it more difficult to formulate the equation of motion. In those cases, numerical methods can be used to determine stresses using the kinematic inputs at a known vibration velocity amplitude and frequency. The study presents the method to determine the stresses.</div><div>CORRESPONDING AUTHOR:</div><a href="http://www.diagnostyka.net.pl/Author-Janusz-Zachwieja/60592">Janusz Zachwieja</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:janusz.zachwieja@utp.edu.pl"><div></div></a><div>Mechaniki Stosowanej, UTP Bydgoszcz, prof.
