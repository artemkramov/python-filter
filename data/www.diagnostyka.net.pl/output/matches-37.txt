This article presents the strength and modal analysis of the rotor model of the Tesla micro-turbine. The calculations were made i n order to verify the design of multi-disc turbine’s rotor before production process. Two commercial solvers were used independently, which are capable to deal with problems of solid state physics–Abaqus and Ansys Mechanical with Workbench software. The comparison of results from two applications aimed at checking solvers’ applicability in the present case. Preliminary analysis was carried out in Abaqus software. The calculations were performed assuming perfect bearing stiffness for different rotation speeds. A more detailed analysis was made in Ansys Mechanical software using structure analysis modules to determine the stresses in the structure which arise as a consequence of rotor’s rotational motion. Subsequently, it was followed up with modal analysis results. Additionally the parameters of selected bearings were determined and modal analysis took into account the stiffness corresponding to individual rolling bearings.
