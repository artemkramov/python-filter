A NOVEL APPROACH TO WEAK SIGNAL PROCESSING
Oleksandr Makarenko, Oleksiy Melnichuk
<p>A novel effective approach to weak continuous and digital signals processing in communication channels with high noise levels&nbsp;is proposed and investigated. The essence of proposed approach is illustrated by examples of various electronic devices.&nbsp;The conditions which allow obtaining the maximal gain in signal to noise ratio are found. This gain exceeds 50 dB for sensitive&nbsp;amplifier and approximately equals to 30 dB for detector of digital cosine video impulse. It is shown that the proposed&nbsp;approach ensures obtaining a lot more gain in signal to noise ratio compared to existing technical solutions. The considered&nbsp;advantages of the described devices allow employing the proposed approach to effective information processing in communication&nbsp;systems with low operating power.</p>
