METHOD OF LTE FUNCTIONAL UNITS ORGANIZATION WITH EVOLVED PACKET CORE VIRTUALIZETION
Maria A. Skulysh, Oleg S. Klimovych
Today LTE functional units are implemented on software and hardware that limits its scalability. Moreover, all information flows tied to the network operator topology to sites where are special network equipment for traffic counting and to monitor QoS. The usage of network functions virtualization can help to replace a specialized network device on the software that runs on general-purpose processors. Thus, it can reduce costs through the application of ready-made servers for the implementation of new network functionality. In the article the method of distribution of EPC functions between the active network equipment and cloud infrastructure, which is used for computation. Also algorithm of interaction of network elements at client connects to the network is proposed. This will increase the flexibility and productivity of the process provision services mobile broadband.
