SURVEY OF SATELLITE TECHNOLOGIES APPLYING IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
Alexander Lysenko, Valeriy Novikov, Tatyana Pryschepa, Sergey Kashuba
<p><strong>Background.</strong>There are scenarios of wireless sensor networks application, in which the use of terrestrial communication&nbsp;becomes unacceptable: a considerable distance between the sensor nodes, destruction of land lines during natural disasters and&nbsp;al. The alternative terrestrial communication to solve the problem to ensure the transmission of information from the sensor&nbsp;nodes can be the use of satellite communication channels. However, the use of satellite channels makes high demands on&nbsp;power transceivers, which imposes restrictions on the characteristics of the sensor nodes.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is review of existing methods of application of satellite communication channels in&nbsp;wireless sensor networks.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Analysis of well-known publications on the use of satellite communication channels in wireless sensor&nbsp;networks, revealed specific scenarios in which the use of satellite channels can be an effective solution.<br><strong>Results.</strong>It was found that, despite the additional complexity of the use of satellite communication channels in wireless&nbsp;sensor networks associated with the energy constraints of sensor nodes, satellite channels are able to provide the territorial&nbsp;flexibility for deployment of wireless sensor networks.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The use of satellite communications in wireless sensor networks has a number of unresolved problems. One&nbsp;example is problem of multiple access organization in satellite channel for high satellite channel utilization depends on payload&nbsp;traffic nature. A promising area of application of satellite communication channels in wireless sensor networks is a method of&nbsp;forming a data channel from a group of spaced sensor nodes with limited energy, which is based on the principles of phased&nbsp;arrays.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>wireless sensor networks; satellite channel
