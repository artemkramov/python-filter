RESONATORS OF MECHANICALLY TUNABLE WAVEGUIDE FILTERS FOR TROPOSPHERIC COMMUNICATION
Petro Stepanenko
<p>The class of resonators which allows building mechanically tunable waveguide bandpass filters with near constant bandwidth&nbsp;in overall a wide tuning frequency range has been investigated. The concept comprising in a successful combining inductive&nbsp;and capacitive discontinuities to obtain near constant quality factor of resonators in wide frequency variation range is implemented.&nbsp;It is proved that the most technologically advanced solution can be obtained by using the waveguide connections containing&nbsp;double ridged sections for compensation of phase shifts in resonators appearing because of frequency variation. Adequate<br>mathematical models of the resonators based on generalized scattering matrix approach are obtained. The diffraction&nbsp;problems for doubled discontinuities, such as doubled ridged sections in rectangular waveguide, have been solved by the integral&nbsp;equation method. The calculation of resonance frequencies and quality factors of resonators are carried out in wide dimension&nbsp;range variations. Due to near constant quality factors over wide tuning frequency range, the developed waveguide resonators&nbsp;open new possibilities in realization of high efficient and cost effective frequency tunable filters of transmit tropospheric&nbsp;stations and various telecommunication systems for tropospheric communication.</p>
