METHODS OF MULTI-CRITERIA OPTIMIZATION IN PLANNING NETWORKS OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION
Valerii Bezruk, Daryna Сhebotarova
<p>The features of the use of multi-criteria optimization methods to solve design problems of mobile communication networks are&nbsp;considered. The article is aimed to solve the relevant scientific and applied problem of planning and optimization of cellular&nbsp;mobile communication networks along with taking into account the totality quality indices, based on the application of multicriterial&nbsp;optimization methods. Examples illustrating how to select optimal design decisions while networks of mobile communication&nbsp;planning taking into account the totality of quality indices are given.</p>
