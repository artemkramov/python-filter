MULTIROUTE CROSS-LAYER TRANSPORT PROTOCOL WITH RELIABLE DATA DELIVERY
Iurii Voitenko
<p>A multiroute cross-layer transport protocol with data delivery capabilities for mobile networks is proposed. Protocol combines&nbsp;routing functionality with reliable data delivery. It is shown that finding multiple routes to the destination can be successfully&nbsp;combined with a connection establishment for connection-oriented protocols such as TCP. Establishing a connection over multiple&nbsp;routes can significantly decrease the time of the connection recovery when some routes become unavailable thus increasing&nbsp;total throughput of transport protocol in mobile networks environment. Performance analysis of the proposed protocol indicated<br>that in mobile sensor networks with 5-10% of packet losses its throughput is approximately 60% higher than throughput&nbsp;of TCP-Reno2 flowing over shortest path.</p>
