SOME THOUGHTS ON RF ENERGY HARVESTING
Sergey Bunin, Roman Zhogov
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Energy harvesting is the actual topic. The system for energy harvesting has many components&nbsp;which require complex designing.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is optimal ways of collecting and accumulation of electromagnetic energy.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Analysis of all known publications devoted to the energy harvesting, and induction of optimal&nbsp;elements for the energy harvester.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Optimal solutions and some practical implementations were proposed for each element of the energy&nbsp;harvester. Moreover, IR-UWB signals were proposed as a candidate for energy effective communications.<br><strong>Conclusion.</strong>Energy harvesting can be effectively used for power supply for some devices (for instance,<br>sensors). Also, energy effective communications (for instance, IR-UWB) can be used in those devices.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>energy harvesting; UWB; sensors; supercapacitors
