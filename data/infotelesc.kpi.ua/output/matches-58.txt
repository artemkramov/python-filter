THE PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS OF DISCRETE INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM NEAR THE SHANNON BORDER
Alina Moshynska
<p><strong>Background</strong>. The channel capacity and productivity assessments give a chance for system analysis principles development&nbsp;in applied information theory for telecommunication. The central task in the bounds of proposed research is the study of&nbsp;discrete communication channel (DCC) productivity.<br><strong>Objective</strong>. The main task of current study is the analysis of discrete communication channel productivity through&nbsp;identification of the regularities in reliability behavior of modulation multi-position keying signals. Integral productivity&nbsp;assessment is the efficiency metric of communication channel resources usage.<br><strong>Methods</strong>. Solving the main task of research generates bases on the finding the informational abilities of DCC. These&nbsp;informational abilities of DCC are expressed by channel capacity and productivity per one bit of information. Finally, the&nbsp;interdependence between channel capacity and productivity expressed via the information efficiency parameter ηС is the&nbsp;integral productivity estimation for DCC. The case of multiposition keying with its varieties (QPSK, QAM-16, and QAM-64)&nbsp;creates significantly bigger interest.<br><strong>Results</strong>. The model of discrete information transfer system that includes source of discrete information, discrete&nbsp;communication channel with noises, defined method of signal forming and method of transmitted signal processing is<br>proposed. The regularities of the channel capacity change and productivity of a discrete communication channel are&nbsp;established.<br><strong>Conclusions</strong>. The hypothesis of the existence of extremes (upper limits) performance of DCС in discrete information&nbsp;transfer system without limitations on the received signals reliability is practically substantiated. Quantitative assessment to the&nbsp;discrete communication channel capacity and productivity extrema are presented. For achieving required reliability is noiseimmunity<br>coding as the recognized tool in the Shannon theory.<br><strong>Key words</strong>: information theory; productivity; channel capacity; information efficiency.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>information theory; productivity; channel capacity; information efficiency
