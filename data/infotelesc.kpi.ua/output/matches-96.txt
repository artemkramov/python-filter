PRINCIPLES OF THREE DIMENSIONAL SPATIAL MULTIPLEXING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
Oleksandr V. Mazurenko, Yevhenii A. Yakornov
<p>This paper presents a comparative analysis of the multiplexing principles, allowing increasing the technical efficiency of radio&nbsp;resource usage based on the three-dimensional signals spatial separation in a spherical coordinate system. These methods allow&nbsp;creating spatial multichannel communications between certain points (areas) of the space through the radiators and signal processing&nbsp;system of wireless base station. Three-dimensional spatial selectivity in spatial matched filtration is provided by the&nbsp;physical processes of the focusing and the differentiation signals by their front curvature, and in the spatial correlation signal&nbsp;processing – by orthogonality of spreading sequences, their reusing by cyclic shift and synchronization, depending on the distance&nbsp;from the base to the mobile station.</p>
