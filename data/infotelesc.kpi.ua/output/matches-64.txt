ADVANCED APPROACH TO PRODUCTION WORKFLOW COMPOSITION ON ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE PORTALS
Rina Novogrudska, Tatyana Kot, Larisa Globa, Alexander Schill
<p><strong>Background.</strong>In the environment of engineering knowledge portals great amount of partial workflows is concentrated. Such&nbsp;workflows are composed into general workflow aiming to perform real complex production task. Characteristics of partial&nbsp;workflows and general workflow structure are not studied enough, that affects the impossibility of general production workflow<br>dynamic composition.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>Creating an approach to the general production workflow dynamic composition based on the partial workflows&nbsp;meta-descriptions comparison on engineering knowledge portals.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Analysis of the partial parameters workflow and characteristics and the structure of general production workflow of&nbsp;knowledge portals made it possible to specify rules for partial workflows inclusion into general production workflow (based on&nbsp;workflows meta-descriptions comparison), to design algebraic model of general production workflow and develop the production<br>workflow tree forming method.<br><strong>Results</strong>. Experimental investigation was made on the application of suggested approach to general production workflow&nbsp;dynamic composition for real complex production workflow of engineering knowledge portal “Calculation of the strength for the&nbsp;power components of magnetic systems”.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The approach to the general production workflow dynamic composition on engineering knowledge portals is&nbsp;suggested, that allows, based on comparison of the partial workflows meta-descriptions values, choosing from their set workflows&nbsp;that are required to perform real complex workflow.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>workflow; production process; knowledge portals; algebraic model.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>workflow; production process; knowledge portals; algebraic model
