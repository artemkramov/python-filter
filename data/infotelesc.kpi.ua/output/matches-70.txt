MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE SATELLITE SYSTEM PROVIDING PNT INFORMATION FOR MOVING OBJECTS UNDER GNSS VULNERABILITY
Viktor Gaidamanchuk, Mykola Matvienko
<p><strong>Background.</strong>GNSS systems are the main source of PNT information (positioning; navigation; timing) for different systems that can be applied in industries, scientific research and defense. GNSS signal outages, whether natural or as intentional influence (jamming; spoofing), become an increasing problem and are the reason for research aimed at using alternative GNSS sources of PNT information, especially for moving objects.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>General design synthesis of the system providing PNT information to moving objects based on atomic clocks, satellite communication system CSPC channels and VSAT spread spectrum stations with phased antenna array for application on both fixed and moving objects.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>The satellite system providing PNT information modeling and research of possibility to realize main developed technical solutions based on FPGA and USPR technologies to be used on-board moving objects.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Modeling and operation analysis of the system providing PNT information to moving objects based on atomic clocks, satellite communication system CSPC channels and VSAT spread spectrum stations with phased antenna array confirm possibility of using such solution for moving objects provided the maximum integration level of the devices to be installed on these objects.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Wide application of GNSS systems (GPS, BeiDou, GLONASS etc.) in a large number of critical industries suggests that their stable operation or timely redundancy in case of possible problems demands careful attention to development of different compensation scenarios for different applications. Discussed constructing principles of local satellite navigation system for GNSS vulnerability compensation can be of use in solving this important problem.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>GNSS vulnerability; PNT; UAS; UAV; SCPC; DSSS; VSAT.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>GNSS vulnerability; PNT; UAS; UAV; SCPC; DSSS; VSAT.
