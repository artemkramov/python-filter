STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION OF NEURAL NETWORK FOR QUALITATIVE EVALUATION METHOD OF IT-INFRASTRUCTURE FUNCTIONING
Yaroslaw Dorogyy, Sergii Telenik, Dmytro Halushko
<p><strong>Background.</strong>For today, the unit neural networks are widely used to solve various problems. In this regard, the issue of&nbsp;developing learning algorithm that would be able to optimize the structure of neural networks dynamically is very important.&nbsp;The existence of such a method would allow the researcher to get the structure of the neural network that would be available&nbsp;input data quickly. IT infrastructure allows an organization to deliver IT solutions and services to its employees or customers&nbsp;and is usually internal to an organization and deployed within owned facilities<br><strong>Objective.</strong>In most cases, organizations are able to manage individual elements within their IT infrastructure. But,&nbsp;previously, it is necessary to estimate current quality level of service (QoS) or IT infrastructure functioning generally. In a&nbsp;complex IT infrastructure with mutual influence of its elements it is hard to estimate a quality or its operating.<br><strong>Method.</strong>Taken into a large number of IT infrastructure elements it is important to choose a structure of neural networks&nbsp;automatically. The proposed method makes it possible to control processes inside IT-infrastructure and to form the control actions&nbsp;taking into account the quality of the functioning of IT infrastructure components which makes it advisable to use a control loop<br>targeted at improving the quality indicators of the performance of the IT-infrastructure.<br><strong>Results.</strong>This paper proposes to use neural networks to evaluate a quality of IT infrastructure functioning. Since the task of&nbsp;determining the structure of the neural network is almost impossible, because it requires a deep analysis of each process taking&nbsp;place in the IT infrastructure, the paper proposes to define the structure of the neural network automatically using structural&nbsp;optimization algorithm of neural network. Series of experiments constructed algorithm that demonstrate the ability to use it in&nbsp;problems of classification of data.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The proposed method makes it possible to control processes inside IT-infrastructure and to form the control&nbsp;actions taking into account the quality of the functioning of IT-infrastructure components which makes it advisable to use a control&nbsp;loop targeted at improving the quality indicators of the performance of the IT-infrastructure. Also the resulting structure of neural<br>network can be used in a quality estimation of functioning of similar IT infrastructure elements. This will allow the service provider&nbsp;“on the fly” construct and retrain its existing models in a shorter period.<br><strong>Key words:</strong>IT infrastructure; neural networks; the control actions; quality estimation.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>IT infrastructure; neural networks; the control actions; quality estimation.
