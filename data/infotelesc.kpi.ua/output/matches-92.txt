MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR COMPLEX BIOTECHNICAL OBJECTS OF AGRICULTURAL APPOINTMENT
Vitalii Lysenko, Valerii Koval, Kateryna Nakonechna, Dmytro Kalian
<p><strong>Background.</strong>In modern world, the tasks of forming appropriate control strategies for various biotechnical objects of agricultural purpose are aimed at minimizing energy costs. Traditional control systems for complex biotechnical<br>objects in conditions of high energy costs are inefficient. It is proposed to develop energy-efficient intelligent control systems using, as a criterion of efficiency, enterprise profits and modern information technologies.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is the creation of energy efficient intelligent control systems based on the analysis of natural disturbances, biological component states, price policy, continuous monitoring of the power grid<br>equipment operation mode parameters’ stability.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>The analysis of existing traditional control systems for complex biotechnical objects in conditions of high energy cost made it possible to identify effective solutions for improving the reliability of integrated power supply systems for the agro-industrial complex and developing energy-efficient control systems for complex biotechnical objects.<br><strong>Results.</strong>The solution to the problem of minimizing energy costs has been obtained, which contributes to an increase in the production profit in general, due to the formation of appropriate control strategies for electrical facilities<br>that are components of technological equipment.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The modern theory of automatic control makes it possible to develop, using information technologies, energy-efficient control systems for complex biotechnical objects on the basis of analysis of natural disturbances,<br>states of the biological component, price policy in the market of marketable products, and continuous monitoring of the power network equipment operation mode parameters’ stability.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>automatic; infocommunication; energy efficiency; electrotechnics; control; synchronization; monitoring.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>automatic; infocommunication; energy efficiency; electrotechnics; control; synchronization; monitoring.
