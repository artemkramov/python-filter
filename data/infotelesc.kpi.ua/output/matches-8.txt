SCATTERING MATRICES OF LONGITUDINALLY COMPLICATED WAVEGUIDE STRUCTURES
Petro Stepanenko
<p>An approach to the calculation of longitudinally complicated waveguide structures is developed based on integral equation&nbsp;method. A problem of electromagnetic wave diffraction on the complicated structure consisting of a great number of connected&nbsp;waveguide sections has been solved in rigorous formulation. The expressions for its generalized scattering matrices which order<br>is limited only by capabilities of computation technology are obtained. A designing technique for calculation of waveguide&nbsp;connections symmetrical with respect to the transverse plane passing through the middle of the structure perpendicularly to its&nbsp;longitudinal axis has been proposed. This technique is based on the solution of two simultaneous systems of linear algebraic&nbsp;equations with complex coefficients. The mathematical model of the symmetrical waveguide structure in the form of two simultaneous&nbsp;systems of linear algebraic equations with real coefficients is derived for estimation of single mode scattering matrix.&nbsp;The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by example of definition of mathematical models for calculation&nbsp;of scattering matrices of diaphragm of finite thickness and resonant enlargement between two circular waveguides. Proposed&nbsp;and known techniques for calculation of scattering matrices of these structures regarding the cost of computer time are compared.&nbsp;For the correct providing of this comparative analysis, the expressions for obtaining generalized scattering matrix of two&nbsp;circular waveguides junction are derived as a special case of scattering matrix of doubled discontinuity. It is shown that the&nbsp;proposed design technique based on the solution of simultaneous systems of linear algebraic equations which number is&nbsp;equaled to a number of discontinuities in waveguide structure ensures significant cost savings of computer time in comparison&nbsp;with the known approach based on the consecutive combining of generalized scattering matrices of separate junctions.</p>
