WIRELESS TERAHERTZ COMMUNICATIONS WITH SPECTRAL MODULATION OF ULTRA-WIDEBAND NOISE SIGNALS
Mikhail Ilchenko, Viktor Cherepenin, Valeriy Kalinin, Teodor Narytnik, Valeriy Chapurskiy
An ultra-wideband wireless communication system based on continuous carrier noise signals with low radiation level for digi-tal information transfer in terahertz frequency range has been investigated. Autocorrelation and spectral methods of processing received ultra-wideband noise signals with coded spectral modulation are considered. The error probability on bit of transmit information versus the energetic signal to noise ratio at the receiver input is theoretically analyzed for different bit rate per-formance and frequency band of carrier noise signals. The proposed terahertz wireless communication system is characterized by high interference immunity and information transmission reliability under conditions when the amplitude of desired signal becomes lower then the interference level. The range of radio communication at low radiation power of ultra-wideband carrier noise signals is evaluated. The performed investigations confirm the development possibility of prospective ultra-wideband systems of noise communication.
