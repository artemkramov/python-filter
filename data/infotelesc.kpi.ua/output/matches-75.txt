LTE/MVNO NETWORKS STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION BASED ON TENSOR DECOMPOSITION
Iryna Strelkovskaya, Iryna Solovskaya
<p>The usage of tensor methods on the decomposition basis is offered for the tasks solution of structure optimization for&nbsp;LTE/MVNO networks mobile communication. The choice problem of optimum topology of e-Node B base stations connections<br>in the radio access of E-UTRAN/LTE network was solved. The assessment problem of QoS quality characteristics of&nbsp;complex LTE/MVNO network architecture was solved.</p>
