ESTIMATION THE LOCATION PARAMETERS IN MOTION OF RADIO EMISSION SOURCE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE’S SPHERICAL FRONT
Evgeniy Yakornov, Oleg Tsukanov
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Modern methods for determining the position of the source of radio emission in the Fresnel zone from the sphericity of the electromagnetic wave front received by the linear antenna array allow solving the problem of<br>simultaneous determination of the direction and range only for a stationary source of radio emission. In the case of a radio source, the accuracy of estimating the location parameters will be low.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is to increase the accuracy of the method for estimating the location parameters for a mobile radio source in the case of the sphericity of the electromagnetic wave front, which is adopted by a linear<br>antenna array.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>An estimate of the angular direction during the motion of a radio emission source is made by estimating the phase difference in the “sliding window”. The range estimate is determined from the results of the estimates in the “sliding window” of the difference in phase differences between the symmetric elements of the linear array antenna.<br><strong>Results.</strong>The considered method, based on the results of simulation, makes it possible to increase the accuracy for estimating the location parameters for a mobile radio source by 25-35%.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The proposed method can be easily implemented in mobile monitoring systems of radio emission sources when they are in the Fresnel zone.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>Fresnel zone; radio emission source; sphericity of the electromagnetic wave front; phase difference; difference of phase differences; linear array; sliding window; wavelength; estimation of location parameters.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Fresnel zone; radio emission source; sphericity of the electromagnetic wave front; phase difference; difference of phase differences; linear array; sliding window; wavelength; estimation of location parameters.
