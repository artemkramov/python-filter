THE MODEL FOR ASSESSMENT THE RELIABILITY OF STRUCTURES IN VIRTUALIZED DATA CENTERS
Mykhailo M. Klymash, Olga M. Shpur, Igor B. Tchaikovskyi
In this paper has been proposed model of communication system with dynamic network topology in which the process of changing the topology graph over time is to create or break connections between components within a single physical server or between pairs of components that are located on different machines. An essential criterion is the availability of system performance connectivity graph at the time of transition from one state to another topological and fixed number of nodes. Analysis showed that virtual topological structure of such a cloud network will depend on the probability of failure in the middle of the road segment. The probability of blocking close to zero when the number of available channels is 20-30% of the total subscribers</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>assessment the reliability of structure; virtual structure; virtualized data center; structure stability; cloud technology
