CREATION OF PSEUDO-RANDOM SEQUENCES BASED ON CHAOS FOR FORMING OF WIDEBAND SIGNAL
Anatoly Semenko, Nikolai Kushnir, Natalia Bokla, Grigoriy Kosovan
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Telecommunication systems with a broadband signal have improved noise immunity, the ability to receive a signal in multipath, as well as electromagnetic compatibility with neighboring radio electronic devices. The use of known pseudo-random sequences to create systems doesn’t ensure their high confidentiality due to the possibility of their selection when receiving a signal. A significant increase in the confidentiality of the system can be achieved by using pseudorandom sequences based on chaos.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is the development of a technique for creating pseudo-random sequences based on chaos, as well as the analysis of the correlation characteristics of pseudo-random sequences formed on the basis of a chaotic signal.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Chaotic signals are inherently pseudo-random, but they are generated by deterministic systems. All computer models of chaos are approximations of mathematical chaos. Any analysis of these sequences doesn’t allow them to be<br>reproduced and they can’t be intercepted, so they have significant advantages when used for spreading the signal spectrum and creating a pseudo noise broadband signal. Sequence selection with an acceptable level of side lobes of the autocorrelation function is carried out by using the developed graphical interface method.<br><strong>Results.</strong>It is shown that, based on the chaos of pseudo-random sequences, it is possible to select sequences with side lobe level up to 0.3, suitable for practical use after analysis of their autocorrelation functions.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Using created chaos based pseudo-random sequences is effective for building broadband single-channel telecommunication systems that have a high degree of confidentiality in the information transmission.<br><strong>Keywords</strong>: broadband signal; chaos; pseudorandom sequence; autocorrelation function; confidentiality of information transmission.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>broadband signal; chaos; pseudorandom sequence; autocorrelation function; confidentiality of information transmission.
