WIDEBAND VOLUME HORN ARRAY ANTENNA WITH SWITCHABLE POLARIZATION CAPABILITY
Petro Stepanenko, Sergiy Martynyuk
<p>This paper presents the most valuable theoretical results that confirm the possibility of practical realization of a wideband volume&nbsp;horn array antenna with the switchable polarization capability. Among key features of the proposed antennas are their&nbsp;high stability of switchable linear polarization tilt angle of radiated electromagnetic wave, radiation pattern of sector type and&nbsp;wide operating frequency band. The paper focuses on characteristics of linear horn antenna subarrays as key components of&nbsp;the described volume array antenna. Subarrays fully comprise double-ridge waveguide sections. The cutoff wavenumbers calculation&nbsp;algorithm is developed for the symmetrical double-ridge waveguides to estimate frequency bandwidth of power dividers&nbsp;in their different cross sections. The problem is solved numerically by partial regions method taking into account field&nbsp;singularity on rectangular metal ridges.</p>
