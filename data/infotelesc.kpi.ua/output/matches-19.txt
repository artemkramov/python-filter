HISTORY OF MOBILE RADIO AND SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS
Dimov Ilcev
<p>The safety of navigation through all past ages has been a primary preoccupation for all seamen and shipping owners. Distress&nbsp;and disasters at sea caused by the blind forces of Mother Nature or by human factors have occurred during the course of many&nbsp;centuries on ships and in the life of seafarers. For many centuries, seafarers sailed without incoming information about trip,&nbsp;navigation and weather conditions at sea. At that time, only audio and visual transfers of information from point to point were&nbsp;used. However, no earlier than the end of the 19th century, were developed new disciplines, such as the transmission of news&nbsp;and information via wire initially, then by radio (wireless) and latterly, via modern satellite and stratospheric platform communications&nbsp;systems. The facts about airplanes and land vehicles are well determined and clear because these transport mediums&nbsp;have more reliable environments and routes than ships. After a disaster with airplane, train, truck or bus it is much easier to&nbsp;find out their positions and to provide alert, search and assistance. With the exception of safety demands, an important question&nbsp;is the utilization and development of new mobile radio and satellite communications and navigation systems for commercial&nbsp;and social utilization at sea, on land and in the air.</p>
