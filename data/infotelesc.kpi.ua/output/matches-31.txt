THE GENERALIZED MODEL OF SITUATIONAL PRIORITIES IN ACCESS SYSTEMS
Leonid Uryvsky, Hanna Hakhova
<p><strong>Objective.</strong>Under conditions of limited resources queuing system (QS) with disciplines of different priorities are a powerful conflict-resolving tool. The aim of the paper is to generalize the model of situational priority service based on QS<br>with two streams for one or two servicing devices, and to offer possible scenarios for implementation of situational priorities in access systems.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>The generalized analytical model of queuing system was realized according to the Markov chains theory. This model substantiates the best scenarios that justify the situational priorities implementation.<br><strong>Results.</strong>The result is an analytical description of the generalized model of QS with two streams for one or two servicing devices and the quantitative analysis of scenarios implementation of service priority in access systems. The performance analysis for each stream and overall QS performance was conducted. The recommendations for effective usage of priority service disciplines based on the proposed scenarios were given.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>One of the possible scenarios of situational priorities algorithm implementation was proposed based on the mathematical resource access model. The points of priority change by the selected value of system productivity were illustrated based on the quantitative data.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>access system; queuing system; situational priorities; productivity.
