FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER FOR SMART HOME LIGHTING CONTROL
Igor Olenych
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Modern high-tech automation systems are able to provide unmanned productive and efficient management of smart home functions. These systems should provide control of temperature, light level, humidity and air<br>pollution for a comfortable stay in the building. In particular, fuzzy logic controller has the potential for application in intelligent systems of lighting control.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is to design the two-channel lighting control system in smart home that provides control of lighting source power and of their spectral characteristics.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>The lighting control system is based on fuzzy inference and provides forming the base of fuzzy production rules, fuzzification of input values, aggregation of truth of sub conditions of each rule, activation of conclusions and<br>defuzzification process that generates an output signal to control the smart home functional devices.<br><strong>Results.</strong>The crisp values of light source power with different spectral characteristics and output signal that controls the transparency of windows have been obtained in result of representation of input data of different types using linguistic variables and fuzzy production rules for the current values of natural light and time of day. It is shown the possibility to change the sensitivity of the control systems in different ranges of illumination deviation from optimal values.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The lighting control method in buildings based on fuzzy logic controller enables to get the quantitative values of power of light sources with different spectral characteristics taking into account the individual characteristics of residents.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>lighting control; fuzzy logic controller; production rules; fuzzy sets; conclusions activation.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>lighting control; fuzzy logic controller; production rules; fuzzy sets; conclusions activation.
