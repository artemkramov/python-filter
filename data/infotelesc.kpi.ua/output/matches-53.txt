<p><strong>Background.</strong>One of the promising applications of terahertz technology are communication systems and telecommunications.&nbsp;In particular, it provides for the creation of fundamentally new in size, noise immunity and energy efficiency devices and subterahertz&nbsp;(TGD) for high-speed transmission of video signals, microwave radio systems, line of sight, the fifth generation of&nbsp;transport of distribution of mobile networks (5G) and radar for the purpose of high-precision detection and recognition of small&nbsp;high-speed targets. The development of the element base of electronic devices, the widespread introduction of digital technology&nbsp;formation and signal processing allow a new approach to the solution of many problems of telecommunication systems and sub-&nbsp;TGD. These circumstances make this range unique to the construction of telecommunication systems and networks, including the&nbsp;PPC line of sight for the transport of the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G). Today there is a great need in the organization&nbsp;of high-reliability single-span lines designed for ultra-fast data transmission and exchange of data between computers and&nbsp;peripheral devices. For these purposes, the most suitable for microwave links TGD, the advantages of which are high noise&nbsp;immunity and bandwidth, low energy consumption. The task of developing the transmitting and receiving paths PPC becomes&nbsp;extremely important.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is the development of new circuit technological solutions for creating transmission with high&nbsp;(up to 5 mW) output power and receiver (with high sensitivity - noise ratio of 10 dB) radiopathes terahertz wavelengths.</p><p><strong>Methods.</strong>Analysis of all known publications devoted to the design of telecommunication devices and systems and subterahertz&nbsp;range using microwave photonics technology and electronics, made it possible to offer new scheme-technological&nbsp;solutions create a local oscillator on the basis of quasi-optical power and spatial summation methods and a highly sensitive<br>frequency converters pumped the fundamental harmonic<br><strong>Results.</strong>The modeling and experimental studies of functional units receive and transmit paths of the telecommunications&nbsp;system in the terahertz frequency range 130-134 GHz, consisting of: frequency converters pumped to the primary harmonic&nbsp;oscillator using the quasi-optical power and spatial summation methods, band-pass-filter septum waveguide channel 1,6'0,8 mm.&nbsp;For the first time using the proposed scheme and the authors of the new technological solutions developed transmission (with an&nbsp;output power up to 5 mW) and the receiver (with a noise figure of 10 dB) of the radio terahertz wavelengths.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The created transmission (with an output power up to 5 mW) and the receiver (with noise coefficient at 10 dB)&nbsp;of the radio terahertz wavelength range can be used in the construction of telecommunication systems and networks, including&nbsp;radio-relay systems, line of sight for the transport of mobile next generation networks . Providing bandwidth radio link in the tens&nbsp;of Gb / s or more (required in the future) is possible through the use of terahertz wavelengths, which allows you to not only&nbsp;greater speed of information transmission, but also highly reliable radio communication at a very low weight and envelope&nbsp;transceiver transmitting channel and antenna system.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>computer modeling terahertz range of the radio transmitter and receiver; frequency converters; quasi-optical local oscillator; septum-filter telecommunication system
