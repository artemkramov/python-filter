THE SELF-ORGANIZING RADIO NETWORKS AND ULTRA WIDE BAND SIGNALS
Sergey Bunin
<p>The paper proposes to use impulse radio ultra wide band signals in self-organizing ad hoc and&nbsp;MANET networks to solve multiple access and widen networks coverage area problems. New methods of signals&nbsp;reception and information capacity increasing are proposed.</p>
