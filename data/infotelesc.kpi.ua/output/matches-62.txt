BUILDING PRINCIPLES OF THE NETWORK RESOURCES AND THE NETWORK SERVICES PLATFORM ARCHITECTURES
Yuriy Kovalchuk, Oleg Kopiyka, Oksana Roiko
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Task of automation of productive and administrative processes, operating activity, general system providing,&nbsp;and also facilities, that provide creation, treatment, maintenance, moving away and transporting of information is actual. The&nbsp;united system of business processes allows conducting the synthesis of information and communication systems for national&nbsp;operator of telecommunications and informatization industry.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The objective is to develop the information systems architecture and the platforms of network resources and&nbsp;network services which are based on conception of the information and communication systems synthesis that automate the&nbsp;production and management processes, operation activities, production means and system-wide ensuring of the&nbsp;telecommunications operator.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>The method of the communications infrastructure synthesis that receives convergent properties to provide&nbsp;personalized services to the end user, which is based on the developed methodology and methods and allows the client to&nbsp;implement the principle of self-configuration services to get the whole range of modern converged information and&nbsp;communication services to the agreed quality (QoS) is proposed.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Architectures of telecommunication services capital of telecommunication operator are considered, which include&nbsp;the platforms of network resources and network services. The method of synthesis of communication infrastructure which gets&nbsp;convergence properties for the grant of personally services for end user is offered.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Description of methodological bases of synthesis of information-communication systems of&nbsp;telecommunication operator is presented, here, the synthesis of the systems is given by possibility to create the unique&nbsp;informative platform which is presented as universal architecture information and communication systems.<br><strong>Keywords</strong>: information and communication systems, telecommunications operator; information systems architecture and&nbsp;platforms of network resources and network services.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>information and communication systems, telecommunications operator; information systems architecture and platforms of network resources and network services.
