INCREASE OF INFORMATIVE CAPACITY OF ULTRA WIDE BAND IMPULSE SIGNALS
Sergii Bunin
<p>It is common to think that impulse radio ultra band signals (IR-UWB) in communication systems can carry the information at&nbsp;very high rates. But each impulse of the signal can carry just one bit of information. In radio networks it is necessary to add&nbsp;destination address to every information unit. The best way for each subscriber is use series of impulses mutually orthogonal to&nbsp;the rest of series in the network. But the orthogonality means long multi impulse series with low density of impulses to make&nbsp;time domain space transparent. As a result, data transmission rates become much less than expected. To increase data rates in&nbsp;radio networks modulation of each impulse by amplitude, duration and polarity in the series is proposed. Examples of transmitter&nbsp;and receiver are presented. As a result, informative loading on signals increases manifold, compensating or neutralizing<br>losses, related to the transmission of symbols by impulse sequences.</p>
