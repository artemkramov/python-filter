DEPENDENCE OF NANOCOMPOSITE SYSTEM “GLASS -Pb2Ru2O6; RuO2" ELECTROPHYSICAL PARAMETERS ON PROPERTIES OF A GLASS AND STRUCTURALLY-PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS
Yaroslav Lepikh, Tatyana Lavrenova
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Electrophysical parameters (EPhP) of hybrid integrated circuits (HIC) thick-film elements or sensor sensitive elements which are formed from “glass - ”Pb2Ru2O6; RuO2" heterophase systems on the given time are characterized by low reproducibility and significant instability. The degradation of thick-film elements characteristics is another problem.</p><p><strong>Objective</strong>. The aim of the paper is to establish the influence on EPhP glass properties as nanocomposite binding agent, structural-phase transformations and mechanisms of electric conductivity.<br><strong>Methods</strong>. Heat treatment of nanocomposites of different structure and their X-ray structure analysis were carried out. Changing of EPhP of films from nanocomposites of different structure, and also factor of linear thermal expansion depending on external factors were determined.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Influence of glass properties and structural-phase transformations in nanocomposite systems “glass - Pb2Ru2O6,RuO2” were established at their annealing. A principal cause of lead ruthenate decomposition and dioxide ruthenium formation is not thermal dissociation of initial current-carrying phase, but chemical reaction at interaction between Pb2Ru2O7-x and glass binding components. It is the consequence of stronger acid properties of binding metal oxides, in particular, boron oxide. Dependence of percentage content, in particular, a current-carrying phase on B2O3 concentration in constant binding<br>are established.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The big content of boron oxide and glass high acidity is a principal cause of chemical decomposition of lead ruthenite and formation of dioxide ruthenium at “glass - Pb2Ru2O6, RuO2” nanocomposite systems annealing.<br>The increase of investigated system nanocomposite layers conduction, at contents of a current-carrying phase increase it is possible to explain by percolating transition owing to occurrence of conducting phase cluster in matrix structure.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>nanocomposite heterophase system “glass- Pb2Ru2O6, RuO2”; structural-phase transformations; electrophysical parameters
