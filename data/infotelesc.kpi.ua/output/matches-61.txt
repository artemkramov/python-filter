MULTICRITERIAL CHOICE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS MEANS USING HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS METHOD
Valeriy Bezruk, Yulia Skorik
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Telecommunications means (systems, devices, technologies etc.) are important components of modern infocommunications.&nbsp;The theoretical and practical aspects of choice of preferable version of telecommunication facilities are&nbsp;examined taking into account totality of quality indexes and judgments of experts on the basis of hierarchical analysis method.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The requirements of strict account of the inconsistent quality indices totality arise when choosing their design&nbsp;versions. This defines the necessity to use methods of multi-criteria optimization when choosing optimal design solutions from&nbsp;a set of admissible versions.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Scientific novelty of the work consists in the application of hierarchy analysis method for comparative analysis&nbsp;and selection of a preferred version of telecommunication means taking into account a set of quality indicators and judgments&nbsp;of experts. Solution of multicriteria optimization problems consists, in the general case, in the search of not one but some set of&nbsp;Pareto-optimal solutions which can be used at designing. Method based on attraction of some additional subjective information&nbsp;in the form of experts’ judgments can be used for narrowing the Pareto set to the unique design solution.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Theoretical and practical aspects of choosing the preferable version of telecommunications means taking into&nbsp;account the totality of quality indices and experts’ judgments based on hierarchical analysis method are considered. Examples&nbsp;of the problems of choice of the preferred version for different types of telecommunication means, in particular, for digital&nbsp;communication systems with different modulation type, different versions for building a mobile network of the 3rd generation,&nbsp;different technologies of mobile networks of the 4th generation, different types of speech codecs are proposed.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Practical features are studied and recommendations are formulated for application of the method of hierarchy&nbsp;analysis in the selection of the preferred design versions of means of telecommunications.<br><strong>Key words:</strong>telecommunications means; multicriteria optimization; Pareto-optimal solutions; choosing of preferred design&nbsp;version; hierarchical analysis method.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>telecommunications means; multicriteria optimization; Pareto-optimal solutions; choosing of preferred design version; hierarchical analysis method.
