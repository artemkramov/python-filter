COMPLEX APPROACH TO SERVICE DEVELOPMENT
Tetiana Kot, Andrey Reverchuk, Larysa Globa, Alexander Schill
Modern companies including telecommunication companies and mobile operators working in the global environment should guarantee technological effectiveness and innovation, renewing their technologies and services. Operation Support Sys-tem/Business Support System is used in telecommunication companies. In current state-of-the-art approaches, several itera-tions involving analysts and system architects are necessary, methodologies allow modeling non-functional or functional re-quirements but they do not take into account the interaction between functional and non-functional requirements as well as collaboration between services. Web Services Agreement is a convenient way to contain QoS parameters but state-of-the-art SLA-aware methods cannot support all classes of non-functional parameters and provide run-time support and dynamic recon-figuration at the same time. The approach proposed in this paper fills this gap. It employs a well-defined workflow and analy-sis model for developing and adapting complex software systems including support of all classes of non-functional parameters and providing run-time support and dynamic reconfiguration of provided services.
