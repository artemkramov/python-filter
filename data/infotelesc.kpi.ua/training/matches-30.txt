AN APPROACH TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR FUTURE WLAN
Andriy Luntovskyy, Mykhailo Klymash
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Nowadays wireless and mobile communication is occupied with provision in general of IP-services and transmission of MM-content from one place to another, but tomorrow the new 5G will be able to control a wide range of objects in real time with only insignificant human intervention. IoT with multiple new attractive apps is created. An important new approach for resource allocation for future WLAN towards 5G has to be discussed within the work.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>DIDO (Distributed Input Distributed Output) – a new technology aimed to provide flexible multiuser wireless LAN everywhere under international voting and conventions for the used frequencies amongst other mobile technologies towards 5G. DIDO is aimed to resource allocation for future wireless communication networks which can use the wide non-traditional frequencies spectra between 3MHz and 30GHz and independently with full bandwidth and higher data rate operate under the distances between 100 m and 1000 km.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Analysis of all known publications devoted to the new generation of mobile communication 5G was done. The interoperability aspects of 5G to WLAN, BT, WSN and other micro- and pico- radio nets were discussed. A new approach to frequency resource allocation for future WLAN was examined.<br><strong>Results.</strong>An overview is given as well as main research points of view for the future 5G of mobile radio networks by the IMT 2020 standard are examined. They include inter alia the technique DIDO (Distributed Input Distributed Output), a perspective resource allocation for future wireless communication networks. The technology should only augment the existing GERAN, UTRAN, SAE and IMS mobile radio infrastructure of previous generations 2G-4G with a flexible world-wide WLAN, which is operated under use of a data bases for available frequency bands and the Web-based content called DIDO Data Centers.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Efficient WLANs as well as DIDO must become a part of 5G systems. By the opinion of some leading companies like Rearden, Microsoft, Samsung, Huawei the method DIDO has to be used as a new resource allocation method for future WLANs.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>5G; WLAN; DIDO; IoT; QoS; QoE (Quality of Experience)
