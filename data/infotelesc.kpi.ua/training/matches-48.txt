DEPENDENCE APPROXIMATION OF THE HURST COEFFICIENT ON THE TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION PARAMETER
Anatolii Lozhkovskyi, Yevgenii Levenberg
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Despite the popularity of the model of self-similar traffic, until now a number of tasks of assessing the quality of service in the packet communication network remains unresolved. Because of the lack of a rigorous theoretical base that can complement the classical queuing theory when designing a packet-based communication network with self-similar traffic, there is no reliable and recognized methodology for calculating parameters and quality indicators for information distribution systems under conditions of the self-similarity effect.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is the improvement of the accuracy of calculating the quality of service characteristics by obtaining a new formula for calculating the traffic self-similarity coefficient, depending on the parameter of the form of the Weibull or Pareto distributions. Self-similar traffic or the time interval between stream packets is described by these distributions.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>To calculate the QoS characteristics, you only need to know the parameter a of the Weibull or Pareto distribution form and there is no need to calculate in a rather complicated way, for example, the R/S-method, the self-similarity coefficient of Hurst for traffic.<br><strong>Results.</strong>A significant difference between the real and the linear dependence of the self-similarity coefficient H on the parameter a of the Weibull distribution form or on the parameter a of the Pareto distribution form is detected.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The use of real functional dependences of H on a allows enhancing the accuracy of calculating the quality of service characteristics.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>quality of service: Hurst coefficient: self-similar traffic.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>quality of service: Hurst coefficient: self-similar traffic.
