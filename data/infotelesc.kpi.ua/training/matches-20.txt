RECEIVER FOR RECEPTION OF IMPULSE RADIO ULTRA WIDE BAND
Сергей Бунин
A method and a receiver for reception of Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) signals are proposed. Instead of impulse energy accumulation the receiver selects impulses temporal positions by comparing amplitude of impulses to noise mean level. Selected impulses are used to start single-shot multivibrator which generates impulses of preset duration and amplitude. The series of generated impulses are selected by a delay line match filter. Error probability of reception is estimated by the ratio of amount of the impulses generated by single-shot multivibrator corresponding to the signal code to the amount of the impulses caused by noise and interference. The method avoids difficulties of recognition and accumulation of very small energy of IR-UWB signals and simplifies construction of matched filter.
