MODEM EQUIPMENT FOR THE NEW GENERATION COMPACT TROPOSCATTER STATIONS
Serhii Kravchuk, Mykola Kaidenko
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Modem equipment of tropospheric communication lines is an important component of modern means of&nbsp;telecommunication. The theoretical and practical aspects of choosing a preferred embodiment of modem equipment, taking into&nbsp;account the aggregate indicators of quality.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>Presentation features the construction of modem equipment of the tropospheric stations of new generation that&nbsp;can provide high data transfer rates with guaranteed quality of service in complex stationary and non-stationary noise inherent in&nbsp;tropospheric channels.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>This goal is achieved by using new technical and architectural solutions to build a modem equipment, spectrally&nbsp;efficient modulation types and coding algorithms of effective adaptation to changing operating conditions. Feasibility of the&nbsp;proposed approaches to the construction of the modem hardware is fulfilled on a prototype of the equipment based on the HSMC<br>ARRadio Daughter Card debugging modules.<br><strong>Results.</strong>The features of constructing of modem equipment of troposcatter stations with high data transfer rate are provided.&nbsp;To reach the limiting parameters of such stations proposed in the application of modem equipment of new technical and&nbsp;architectural solutions, spectrally efficient modulation types (OFDM plus linear modulation) and error-correcting coding, efficient&nbsp;algorithms of adaptation to changing conditions of work, the SDR technology, frame structures of physical layer. The variants of&nbsp;the configuration of modem equipment in relation to the modes of operation of compact troposcatter station.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Ways of improving modem performance to improve the efficiency of modern compact troposcatter radiorelay&nbsp;stations.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>tropospheric communication; modem equipment; adaptation; software-defined radio; channel configurations.
