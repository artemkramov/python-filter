THE CONVOLUTIONAL CODESАNALYSIS TECHNIQUE ON THE OPTIMUM BLOCK CODES GROUNDS
Leonid Uryvskyi, Kateryna Prokopenko, Anton Peshkin
<p>The convolutional codes analysis and synthesis technique is proposed. This technique is optimal according&nbsp;to near Shannon's bound criterion and guarantees a given bit error rate from message source. The proposed&nbsp;technique is based on the well-known optimum block codes synthesis method. As a result, equivalent parameters&nbsp;set of convolutional codes is received. This set corresponds the optimal block code. The algorithm for synthesis an&nbsp;optimal convolutional code is proposed. Examples of optimal convolutional codes analysis and synthesis in the&nbsp;channel with a given energy are presented.</p>
