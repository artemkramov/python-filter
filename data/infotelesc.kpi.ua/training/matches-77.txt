MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS FUNCTIONALLY OBJECT MODEL FOR MONITORING AND CONTROL
Liubov Berkman, Larysa Komarova, Oksana Varfolomeeva, Iryna Pokhabova
<p>The paper chain is seen as a complex system that is subject to management. The complexity of the process of monitoring&nbsp;and control is caused mainly complicated objects. To describe the operation of the facility built its functional and&nbsp;static mathematical model that completely describes the state of the object. The functional and statistical models to determine&nbsp;the probabilistic characteristics of information and communication network as object management. The model&nbsp;allows direct determination of the probability of the phase-out of the facility.</p>
