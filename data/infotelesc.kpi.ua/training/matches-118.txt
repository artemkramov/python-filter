A CONCEPT FOR MODERN VIRTUAL TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERING OFFICE
Andriy Luntovskyy, Dietbert Guetter
<p>High-performance modern Internet allows internal delivery and complement of attractive (mobile) services in the same way&nbsp;and QoS that are in the LANs. The world economics is widely characterized nowadays via the stable trends that the large and&nbsp;mid-range companies and authorities let in ever greater extent to outsource own engineering services via external smaller service&nbsp;providers. A concept for a modern virtual telecommunication engineering office under use of Service-Oriented Architectures&nbsp;and Cloud Computing technologies has been offered. Multiple use cases for virtual telecommunication engineering office<br>have been discussed. As a significant example, the CANDY Framework and Online Platform have been examined. The important&nbsp;development trends for the CAD for network planning regarding to the tool integration and effective access optimization&nbsp;have been discussed. The CANDY system has been represented as an exhibit at CeBIT 2007, 2008, 2011 in Hannover.</p>
