DUAL FREQUENCY CIRCULARLY POLARIZED MICROSTRIP ANTENNA ARRAY
Sergiy Martynyuk, Dmytro Vasylenko
<p>Paper contains the most valuable results of experimental and theoretical investigations of dual frequency circularly polarized&nbsp;microstrip antenna array for smart antenna applications with adaptive space-time processing capability. Geometry of the proposed&nbsp;antenna array was optimized for the operation in two frequency bands located inside IEEE L band. Presented array&nbsp;structure is composed from ten microstrip radiators independently excited via separate coaxial input ports. Two central radiating&nbsp;elements for two frequency bands have circular shapes with slits and are stacked to provide compact sizes and convergence&nbsp;of their phase centers. Peripheral radiators have annular ring with slits topology. Their geometric centers are superposed with&nbsp;the corners of virtual quadrats with the sides equal to the half of the wavelength for the appropriate band to eliminate the appearance&nbsp;of grating lobes and additional nulls in equivalent radiation patterns. The main feature of the array is its compact<br>packaging that causes significant levels of electromagnetic mutual coupling. Last influences and noticeably deteriorates the&nbsp;shapes of radiation patterns, purity of polarization characteristics and reflection characteristics of planar radiators. The geometric&nbsp;parameters of presented array were selected via multi parametric particle swarm optimization method to provide optimum&nbsp;performance of each radiator in compact array packaging. Moreover, several circularly polarized radiators of the described array&nbsp;assembly were rotated around their centers to improve their characteristics and to increase the quality and effectiveness of<br>latter space-time processing of adaptive antenna system. Novel design of the dual frequency circularly polarized array and imperfectness&nbsp;of obtained characteristics are experimentally validated.</p>
