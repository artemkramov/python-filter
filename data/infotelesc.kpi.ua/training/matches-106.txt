«QUADRUPOLE» MODE DR FILTER FOR C-BAND APPLICATIONS
Tetiana Pidgurska, Olexander Trubin
<p>The possibility of reducing the radiation loss of dielectric resonator (DR) to the external environment has been investigated for&nbsp;the first time by applying higher order mode of DR, namely “quadrupole” type, with higher Q factor. The “quadrupole” mode&nbsp;for constructing narrow band-pass filter (&lt;1%) has been studied. The resonant frequencies of dielectric resonator have been&nbsp;calculated on grounds of approximate analytical method as well as finite element method. The coupling coefficients of the rectangular&nbsp;DR with coplanar line have been scrutinized both as a function of the glass substrate’s height, namely bs, on which the&nbsp;DR is situated, and as a function of the DR’s displacement toward the center line, namely y0. The synthesized two-resonator&nbsp;band-pass filter has the improved gain slope. The minimum value of insertion loss at the central frequency of 5.9 GHz is -&nbsp;2.4dB, the shape factor is equal to 3.45.</p>
