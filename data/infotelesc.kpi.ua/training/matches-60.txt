NOISE IMMUNITY CODES DISPLAY IN RELIABILITY CORDINATES
Leonid Uryvskyi, Anton Pieshkin
<p><strong>Background</strong>. Noise immunity codes are widely used in the modern telecommunication systems. The methodology of&nbsp;properties count of convolutional codes, offered by authors before, to the equivalent parameters of block codes gave the&nbsp;opportunity to use the known and new methodologies of estimation of noise immunity block codes for the corresponding&nbsp;estimations of convolutional codes.<br><strong>Objective</strong>. The purpose of this paper is the estimation of maximum possibilities of block and convolutional noise immunity&nbsp;codes in the reliability co-ordinates on the basis of accordance of their equivalent parameters.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Based on Plotkin’s and Varshamov-Gilbert’s boundaries usage the lines of theoretic error-correcting boundary of&nbsp;block and convolutional codes are built in reliability coordinates. The lines allow finding maximum channel probability of&nbsp;error for which error-correcting code exists that can ensure necessary reliability.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Due to search methodic of convolutional code parameters that are equivalent by correcting abilities to block code&nbsp;parameters, complex assessment of error-correcting, informational and forming complexity properties is made on different&nbsp;kinds of error-correcting codes.<br><strong>Conclusions</strong>. For each probability of symbol errors in a communication channel it is possible to estimate the expedience of&nbsp;the use of block and convolutional codes from the standpoint of the necessary reliability provision, informative efficiency and&nbsp;complication of encoding. Investigational limits allow defining maximally possible probability of error, at which there is a&nbsp;code, able to provide necessary authenticity on the output of decoder.<br><strong>Key words:</strong>noise immunity codes; block and convolutional codes; maximum possibilities of error-correcting; Plotkin’s and<br>Varshamov-Gilbert’s boundaries; error of symbols; necessary reliability.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>noise immunity codes; block and convolutional codes; maximum possibilities of error-correcting; Plotkin’s and Varshamov-Gilbert’s boundaries; error of symbols; necessary reliability.
