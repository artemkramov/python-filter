FEATURES OF THE CLOUD SERVICES IMPLEMENTATION IN THE NATIONAL NETWORK SEGMENT OF UKRAINE
Mykhailo Klymash, Ivan Demydov, Mykola Beshley, Olga Shpur
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Cloud computing environments and services on their basis offering unprecedented cost savings,&nbsp;improved exchange of information and the efficiency of the infrastructure. Accordingly, by using these solutions we&nbsp;can increase the efficiency of the national network services segment. Thus the scalable service architecture&nbsp;development of network systems is a key aspect which directly forms the preferred national electronic services, both&nbsp;public and private sectors.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is to find the ways of optimal consolidation of cloud service systems for the&nbsp;timely transformation of single national information space Ukraine. According to the authors, providing an&nbsp;opportunity to influence these processes by government oversight agencies is critical to Ukraine<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Relevance of research in this area is confirmed by the rapid development of commercial technologies&nbsp;that make cloud implementation process simpler, safer and much more productive on the criteria of transparency,&nbsp;integration, expansion (scalability), quality of service. The introduction of cloud services by public and private&nbsp;operators of distributed service platforms requires consolidation of needs for cloud service technologies, and the&nbsp;harmonization of tariffs for their use by public oversight bodies such as NCCIR of Ukraine. Obviously, the&nbsp;developers of cloud service solutions must have the tools available to maintain service availability and quality, based&nbsp;on the technical and target parameters.<br><strong>Results.</strong>Proposed architectural features of the cloud services implementation technologies, including private&nbsp;cloud using existing structures to support the government and civil service systems at significantly reducing capital&nbsp;expenditures, provided support to the required level of security.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Creation of a common cloud service network information environment requires data-centered&nbsp;model (in the long term DaaS), which has trusted data processing center based core, provided with the decent level of<br>protection and functionality, spreading a corresponding policy on all joint data processing centers of national segment&nbsp;cloud network system by means of interoperability, which allows to deliver services demanded here and now, using<br>replication and migration of corresponding services and link data (including inter-operator and cross-platform).</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>cloud-system; cloud computing; virtual machine; cloud structure; government and public service system
