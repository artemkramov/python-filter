SCOPE EXTENSION IN A CONVERGED NETWORK
Olena Tykhonova
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Unified IP-based provisioning of communication services often faces the problem of QoS guarantees during the real-time application traffic transmission. The packet loss and random time delays in statistically multiplexed data flow apparently make a lot of trouble during remote audio/video conversation or machine-to-machine interaction in real time mode. Known IP-based approaches in telecom network engineering can’t meet the highly increasing operator demands and consumer requirements to QoS-aware services; this hinders the Internet and telephone networks convergence with respect to quality of service provision. Therefore, more research needed to effectively address these problems.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is the interoperability scope extension in a converged telecom network to provide realtime data transfer with quality of service support.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>The current state of “Internet+telephone network” along with the synthesis of an advanced interface for a heterogeneous network is analyzed.<br>Results. Basic principles introduced to extend the autonomous network interoperability. A novel mechanism of conveyor transporting modules originated for a converged network to benefit packet and circuit switching unification.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Traditional telecoms and Internet service providers permanently compete for IT market niches having their pros and cons, and vast IP-applications merged on the market. Therefore, no urgent successor-protocol reasonable in a short term. On this agenda, an alternative algorithm proposed for dynamic packet data allocation in a unified network-tonetwork link, which extends the interoperability scope in a converged network. The Gigabit Ethernet linkage outlined based on proposed algorithm.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>networks interoperability; QoS; real-time applications.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>networks interoperability; QoS; real-time applications
