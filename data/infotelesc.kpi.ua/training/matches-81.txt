EVALUATION OF FREQUENCY RESOURCES OF FOCL WITH THE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES
Manko Oleksandr, Katerina Domracheva, Natalia Bokla, Ievgenii Shestopal
<p><strong>Background.</strong>Currently, communication networks are under development of high-speed transmission technology for single channel fiber optic transmission systems, along with intensive introduction of Wavelength Division Multiplexing<br>technology. Thus there are variants of optical channels design with different transmission rate, which may differ by an order or more, e.g., in the STM-16 standard, it is 2.5 Gbit / s, and STM-256 standard - 40 Gbit / s. Thus, issues arise with respect to the comparison of frequency resource in various transmission technologies that provide certain information bandwidth.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is to find solutions that can increase information throughput of FOCL at constant frequency resource.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>FOCL analysis with frequency multiplexing showed the feasibility of a smaller number of channels but with a higher data rate in each channel. In addition, a perspective use of soliton transmission mode to increase capacity is shown.<br><strong>Results.</strong>It was shown that to improve the wavelength division information-bandwidth transmission system in a fixed wavelength band it is plactical to use a minimum number of optical channels while increasing the transmission rate in each of them.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>The possibility to improve information throughput by increasing the number of channels limited by the transmission band of the optical amplifiers. A considerable part of the frequency resource is used for intervals between the optical channels in order to maintain the requirements for inter-channel effect and consideration of the laser frequency instability and its spectral linewidth. Thus, there is a certain margin for further increase of FOCL throughput. This can be achieved by increasing the transmission speed in each optical channel while reducing their number.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong>optical channel; transmission rate; error rate; optical soliton interchannel effect; spectral width.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>optical channel; transmission rate; error rate; optical soliton interchannel effect; spectral width
