TREE STRUCTURE DATA CHANGE DETECTION METHOD
Yuriy Molchanov, Larysa Globa, Nikolay Alexeyev
<p>The new method, increasing efficiency and reliability of change detection in three structures in the Internet data under indetermination&nbsp;of data structure (DTD, XML-Schema) is proposed in this paper. The Boolean linear programming problem was&nbsp;solved in two exact methods – modified Balazs with filter and modified DP method and A modified method for selecting a&nbsp;neural network architecture was proposed. There is also considered publish/subscribe system description enhanced with core&nbsp;module, which provides notifications of changes to subscribers only in case they occurred.</p>
