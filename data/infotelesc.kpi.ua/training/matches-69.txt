MULTI-RESONATOR DUAL-BAND FILTERS ON DIELECTRIC RESONATORS
Tatyana V. Pidhurska
In the current article the concept of multi-resonator dual-band filter has been described. The dual-band filters based on three and four rectangular dielectric resonators have been synthesized that functionate in&nbsp; ТЕ01δ&nbsp; and ТЕ02δ modes. The proposed construction benefits since it doesn’t have additional coupling elements or DR shape complication. The analytical model of dual-band filter has been developed that accounts for two bands simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified by the simulation results obtained by applying finite element method and shows insignificant disagreement. The proposed dual-band filter can be applied for satellite systems that require the transmission of several non-contiguous frequency channels in the one beam.
