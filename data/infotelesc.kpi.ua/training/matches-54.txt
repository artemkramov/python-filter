ESTIMATION OF BANDWIDTH UTILIZATION FOR SHDSL LINK WITH EFM TECHNOLOGY
Vyacheslav Noskov, Anna Kulyas
<p><strong>Background.</strong>The EFM technology is widely used in access network and assumes transformations chain of the Ethernetsignal&nbsp;for its distribution and further transmission through multiple copper lines named pairs. Multipairs mode is used in order to&nbsp;increase the capacity of the link. But copper pairs may have a different parameters and therefore different throughput. In this&nbsp;case non-equal distribution of the Ethernet traffic is used between pairs. But this approach requires transmitting some&nbsp;identificators in order to create original Ethernet frames at the receiving side. These identificators will impact on bandwidth&nbsp;utilization for multipairs connection.<br><strong>Objective.</strong>The aim of the paper is theoretical and practical researches of bandwidth utilization for multipairs SHDSL/EFM&nbsp;connection in depending on traffic type.<br><strong>Methods.</strong>Study all known publications and standards concerning EFM technology. Analyzing frames format for protocols&nbsp;which are used for SHDSL systems with EFM in order to calculate relation between payload and special data. Installation of the&nbsp;SHDSL link with EFM for practical researches.<br><strong>Results.</strong>The theoretical and practical results concerning the bandwidth utilization for multipairs mode are achieved.<br><strong>Conclusions.</strong>Methods of researches and their results may be used for estimation of the real throughput of SHDSL/EFM&nbsp;links during service level agreement (SLA) conclusion with customers.</p></div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>SHDSL; EFM; bandwidth; throughput
