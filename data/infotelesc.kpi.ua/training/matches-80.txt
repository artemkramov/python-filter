MANAGEMENT OF CRITICAL IT-INFRASTRUCTURES
Yaroslav Y. Dorogyy
In the article the terminology and requirements for safe, reliable operation of critical IT infrastructure were defined. The generalized structure of critical IT infrastructure, by its basic level, sub levels and functionality were described. In the paper for the described structure mathematical model of control of resource allocation in the case of inter-independence processes and universal services were proposed.
