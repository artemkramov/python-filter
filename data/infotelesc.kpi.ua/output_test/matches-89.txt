INFORMATION TRANSMISSION METHODS WITH THROUGH THE USE OF STOCHASTIC SIGNALS
Ruslan Didkowsky
The paper provides an overview of information transmission methods through the use of the noise carrier proposed by researchers&nbsp;from the middle of the last century to the present day. It is shown that the main areas of application of autocorrelation&nbsp;systems with the noise carrier is the confidential communication system construction, where the protection of the transmitted&nbsp;information from intercepting and protection of the channel from the extraneous information injecting are of priority. Methods&nbsp;of information transfer, discussed in the paper, allow solving the problem of sustainable communication in difficult conditions&nbsp;of signal propagation with simple technical means, especially in multipath channels. The paper studies the most urgent theoretical&nbsp;and practical problems relating to communication systems with the noise carrier.</p>
