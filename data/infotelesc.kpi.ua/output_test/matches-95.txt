INCREASE OF GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT EFFICIENCY IN THE Ku BAND BASED ON CHANGES OF ITU THRESHOLD VALUES
M. A. Kolomytsev, A. Lipatov, Y. Synepolski
The article is devoted to the estimation of threshold values, regulated by ITU, which determine the necessity of satellite&nbsp;networks coordination in the Ku band. Maximum capacity of geostationary orbit (GEO) for different diameters of<br>earth station antennas, operating in standard DVB-S2 accounting the limitations caused by the parameters of existing&nbsp;satellite networks equipment, is determined. Optimal values of satellitesâ€™ orbital separation, relative increase in allowable<br>noise / and the signal to single-interference ratio / were identified for maximum GEO capacity.</p>
