AN APPROACH TO DYNAMIC WEB SERVICE COMPOSITION
Dmytro Pukhkaiev, Tetiana Kot, Larysa Globa
Today, changeable requirements to modern web-oriented services demand their fast development and constant reengineering.&nbsp;This is realized via dynamic composition of services, allowing to estimate changes of both functional and nonfunctional&nbsp;service parameters. The last ones are considered using Web Services Agreement technique. Nevertheless, state-ofthe-&nbsp;art SLA-aware methods are not able to consider all classes of non-functional parameters. They also donâ€™t provide service&nbsp;run-time support and dynamic reconfiguration. The novel approach to dynamic Web Services Composition, extending SLA&nbsp;with QoS ontology, is described in the paper. It includes service selection agents that use the QoS ontology and WSAgreements,&nbsp;allowing agents to choose the most appropriate service based on quality preferences exposed by service consumer.<br>The proposed approach allows performing dynamic WS composition based on SLA, providing required values of QoS parameters,&nbsp;improving general QoS and decreasing service development and re-engineering time.</p>
