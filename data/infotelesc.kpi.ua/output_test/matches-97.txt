The present paper addresses essential discourse elements of the English language of science in light of the so-called Anglo-American intellectual style. Emphasised here are: various linguistic devices of compression (writing succinctly, avoiding<br>verbosity and negation etc.), keeping subject and verb close together, and common revision patterns. Key standardized&nbsp;discourse models and academic vocabulary – as well as their Ukrainian equivalents – are also discussed. Special attention is&nbsp;given to Active vs. Passive voice usage, and adequate language framing of the author’s viewpoint in scientific discourse.</p>
