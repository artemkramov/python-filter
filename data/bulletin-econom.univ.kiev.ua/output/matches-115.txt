The paper deals about main features of the post-industrial society and the increasing importance of services, especially the intangible services, in modern economics system.
As we can see, in the leading countries of the world, which are the locomotive of the world economy and in the countries that have built their growth on the principles of intellectualization of production and services play a key role in the GDP formation. The expansion of service delivery in these countries was based on a qualitative changes in the production structure and qualitative changes in human society, the principles of its organization and functioning, and the increasing role of human intellectual activity, high education level, increasing average income per capita and high social standards. In the present world economic literature, this situation is characterized by the term ‘Services Revolution’ (Bell, 1972). This is mainly typical for postindustrial society. The definition “service” is interpreted in different ways, that is leading to differences of opinion, inconsistency, ambiguity in the interpretation, diversity of definition. This is primarily due to the fact – services are diverse and numerous, and secondly every scientist defines the essence of the service concept depending on the subject area of the research. Therefore, it is necessary to consider alternative views on services in global economic theory, it will enable us to determine the nature of service and separate special kind of service – namely intangible service as actual category of the current economic system. We can formulate the following definition of services as a special good, service – a special intangible product that is included in the process of production and circulation in the form of a special useful effect from manufacturer on purpose to meet the unique consumer needs (usually intangible). In the post-industrial society occur the processes of transformation of material goods, particular in the structure of any product, in the formation of its value and use value, come to the fore immaterial part of it, and the ideal components of intangible goods in the form of knowledge and skills which are necessary for the production of this good. In addition, clear difference between production technologies, marketing material goods and services disappears. As a whole with the complications processes of human needs and complexity of production technology, occur complication and transformation in definition utility of services, service differentiation increases their utility too. Based on the commodity nature of intangible services, it can be seen as a set of useful actions during the interaction of consumers and manufacturer to meet specific needs. Considering intangible services, we note that most of them are private goods, which are characterized by categories competition and exclusivity.</p><p>Keywords: post-industrial economics, intangible service, needs, economic interest, service economics</p><p>DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17721/1728-2667.2015/173-8/7">http://dx.doi.org/10.17721/1728-2667.2015/173-8/7</a></p><h5
