Insurer’s choice of the priority type of insurance under uncertainty using game theory and decision-making criteria is grounded. The priority types of insurance for investigated insurance company are
identified. These are such types of insurance: compulsory insurance of civil liability of owners of vehicles; voluntary cargo and luggage insurance; accident insurance; voluntary medical insurance. The advantages and disadvantages of using game theory in the field of determination of priority types of insurance for insurer are found. The advantages include the relative simplicity and availability of the method, taking into account the different states of the environment, simultaneous comparison of different types of insurance. The advantages include ignoring the principle of diversification of the insurance activity and some contradiction in the results obtained from the gains matrix based on insurance premiums and loss matrix based on insurance payments. That is why it is better to compile matrix not for all types of insurance but for some groups such as property insurance, liability insurance etc. It is also necessary to combine game theory and other methods to reach more precise results.</p><p>Keywords: insurer, type of insurance, uncertainty, decision-making criteria.</p><p>Date of submission 08.01.17</p><p>DOI:<a href="https://doi.org/10.17721/1728-2667.2017/190-1/7">https://doi.org/10.17721/1728-2667.2017/190-1/7</a></p><p
