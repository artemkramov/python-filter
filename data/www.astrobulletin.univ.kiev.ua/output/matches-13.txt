<br>The solar corona observed during the total solar eclipse of August 1, 2008 was compared with model configuration of open magnetic lines in the solar corona started near the solar limb. Magnetic field in the solar corona was calculated in the classic (line-of-sight) approach of a potential field – source surface model. The synoptic data of photosphere magnetic field from the Wilcox Solar Observatory was used as low boundary condition. Polar field corrections 0 to 1200 microTesla and the saturation factor of 1.8 were used in calculations. The source surface was situated at the distance of 2.5 solar radii. Observed parameters of coronal rays from (Pishkalo and Baransky, Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies, 2009, 25, 315–318) were compared with the modeled ones. The best agreement of observed and modeled parameters was found when the calculation were made with polar field correction of about 600 × cos 8 (θ) mcTesla. It was concluded that during the total solar eclipse of 2008 the strength of magnetic field at the solar poles was averaged to 650–700 microTesla at the photosphere and to 13–14 microTesla at the source surface.
