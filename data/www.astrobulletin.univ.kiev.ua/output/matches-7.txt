<br>Each comet has individual characteristics that are important for building models of the Solar system, and most comets. In this paper presents the results of treatment of 9099 observations of comet C/2009 P1 (Garradd) during the period from 27.09.2008 to 02.26.2014. The light curve of the comet C/2009 P1 (Garradd) is constructed. The photometric parameters are calculated. Obtained the following values of the photometric parameters: H0 before perihelion is 7.32 ± 0.25, and n respectively 5.43 ± 0.42; after perihelion H0 is 6.29 ± 0.49, and n respectively 9.02 ± 0.98. It can be seen from the curve that near perihelion comet activity increased: brightness of the comet undergoes significant fluctuations. Obviously, at this time effective mechanisms are started in comet that cause increased outgassing. The sharp weakening of the comet’s brightness after growth indicate that this gas sources is temporal. This suggests that near perihelion possible mechanism of amplification of the gas can be icy grains (ice fragments) that give additional temporary increase in brightness of the comet. The correlation coefficients between the change brightness of the comet and changing manifestations of solar activity, namely Wolf numbers, sunspot areas, streams of protons and electrons are calculated. Correlation coefficients were calculated by the method proposed by O. Dobrovolsky. Correlation coefficients were calculated taking into account the fact that a particular manifestation of solar activity reaches the comet over a period of time (been taken from 0 to 28 days). The relationship between the change in brightness of the comet and manifestations of solar activity is not installed.
