<br>There were correctly selected asteroid families with the help of WISE data-base containing more then 100,000 asteroid albeods and sizes. It was revealed a significant decrease of albedo at the semimajor axes increase inside of the families. Itpoints on a non-gravitational effect (NGE) action, which caused a spatial separation of asteroids with different albedos. There were carried out numerical calculations for asteroid orbit evolutions. A comparing of the calculation results with the catalog data denotes an action of similar NGE. Those results confirm the previous conclusions of the authors which were obtained on the base of IRAS data-base, containing 2228 albedo and size of the asteroid.
