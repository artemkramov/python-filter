<br></span>Different dark matter (DM) models predict various clustering properties, i.e. the possibility of DM to form massive objects on different scales.&nbsp;The lower mass limit of these objects according to [1, 2]. may be of the order of planetary masses. The gravitational microlensing can be used to&nbsp;confirm or to reject the existence of such structures and therefore to argue in favor or against concrete DM theories. There are observational&nbsp;programs (OGLE, EROS etc) yielding the light curves of a remote objects in high amplification events (HAE) due to microlensing on foreground&nbsp;masses of the Galaxy. In case when the foreground mass is an extended one, then the light curve in HAE must differ from the light curve due to&nbsp;ordinary microlensing on a point mass. However the question is: what is the value of this difference and is it possible to register this difference with&nbsp;modern observational facilities. This question has been studied elsewhere [3–5] by means of special model lens mappings. In this paper we study&nbsp;this problem starting directly from mass distribution of the extended structure. Namely, we consider microlensing on an extended DM clump with&nbsp;the cored spherically-symmetric mass profile (without a singularity in the center).&nbsp;After some rescaling the lens mapping has the form</p><p><img src="http://www.astrobulletin.univ.kiev.ua/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/zhd.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="42">&nbsp;where R characterizes the size of the clump. For</p><p><img src="http://www.astrobulletin.univ.kiev.ua/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/zhd1.jpg" alt="" width="121" height="28"></p><p>&nbsp;the mapping can have either one or three images; two critical images can merge with each other and disappear when the&nbsp;point source crosses the caustic and their brightness amplification is infinite. For R &gt; γλ there is no caustics and there is the only image.&nbsp;We present examples of the amplification curves in both cases. Then we generate the amplification curves in case of the extended clump model&nbsp;for different values R,γ when the clump moves uniformly with respect to the line of sight with some impact parameter p and velocity V. These&nbsp;curves are then fitted with the point microlens model (with free parameters р and V) and we estimate the difference between the curves. The general&nbsp;outcome is that the amplification curves in case of the extended clumps are very similar to those in case of the point microlens (with appropriately&nbsp;chosen parameters p and V that cannot be derived from observations independently), and it would be difficult to distinguish them on the basis of&nbsp;observations if we deal with p ~ 1 (i.e., of the order of the Einstein radius) and larger. For R larger than ~ (5 ÷ 7) γ the amplification is too small so&nbsp;that the event could be observed. This confirms analogous earlier results [7] obtained within different lens models. The general outcome is that for&nbsp;an observational confirmation or refutation of the existence of the stellar mass extended microlenses it is necessary to continue the programs like&nbsp;OGLE and EROS, and a refinement of the photometric accuracy is highly desirable.
