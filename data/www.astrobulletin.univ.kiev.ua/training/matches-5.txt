We present the television occultation observations at the Astronomical Observatory of National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv during the period of 2013-2014. The information about the methodology of observation and processing of the video was provided. An important element of the television complex is the exact time registration subsystem. Special programs provide necessary time precision. The first one allows to record the time of each frame referred to the computer system time. The second, which works independently in the background, allows recording the protocol differences between the system and the world times. Joint processing of two protocols allows obtaining the absolute time reference with an accuracy of 20 ms. Exploiting this system during a one year period, we were able to observe about 400 occultation. Most informative are observations of double and multiple stars. Within this paper, we present following occultation of multiple stars. 1. Occultation of triple star ZC787 on 8 of March 2014. All three components of the projection distance to the direction of the Moon motion: 2.78 and 0.58-0.62 “and relations between brightness component I1 / I2 / I3 = 1:0.38:0.98 were registered. Hereinafter we number the component by the Moon occultation sequence. There is reason to suspect the presence of the unknown component with distance 0.04 ” from the third component with 0.9 probability. In the case the fourth component presence I1 / I2 / I3 / I4 = 1:0.38:0.36:062. 2. Occultation of double star ZC 944 on 9 of March 2014. Two components with the projection distance to the direction of the Moon motion 0.42 ” were recorded. Relations between components brightness are I1/I2 = 0.55 ± 0.19. 3. Occultation of double star X 87071 (A), ZC 975 (B) on 3 of May 2014. This phenomenon is unique, because we were able to register tangential occultation with multiple brightness falls during the occultation of the one component. Moreover, a clear diffraction pattern during the second component occultation was captured. 4. Occultation of star SAO 95645 on 3 of May, 2014. – It is a double star with a convenient location of the component and position angle for observations. However, the photometric curve of occultation shows no duality. This might be explaine deither by essential different location of the components or by the fact that this star is not double.
