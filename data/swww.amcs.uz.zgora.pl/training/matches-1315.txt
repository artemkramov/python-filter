Regional boundary observability: A numerical approach
El Hassane Zerrik, Hamid Bourray, Ali Boutoulout
In this paper we review the concept of regional boundary observability, developed in (Michelitti, 1976), by means of sensor structures. This leads to the so-called boundary strategic sensors. A characterization of such sensors which guarantees regional boundary observability is given. The results obtained are applied to a two-dimensional system, and various cases of sensors are considered. We also describe an approach which leads to the estimation of the initial boundary state, which is illustrated by simulations.
