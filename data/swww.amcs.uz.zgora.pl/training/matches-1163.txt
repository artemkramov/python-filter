Stability and stabilizability of a class of uncertain dynamical systems with delays
Mohammed Salah Saadni, Mohammed Chaabane, Driss Mehdi
This paper deals with a class of uncertain systems with time-varying delays and norm-bounded uncertainty. The stability and stabilizability of this class of systems are considered. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) delay-dependent sufficient conditions for both stability and stabilizability and their robustness are established.
