Positive partial realization problem for linear discrete-time systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
A partial realization problem for positive linear discrete-time systems is addressed. Sufficient conditions for the existence of its solution are established. A procedure for the computation of a positive partial realization for a given finite sequence of the values of the impulse response is proposed. The procedure is illustrated by four numerical examples.
