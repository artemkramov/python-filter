On an infinite dimensional linear-quadratic problem with fixed endpoints: The continuity question
K. Maciej Przyłuski
In a Hilbert space setting, necessary and sufficient conditions for the minimum norm solution<em>u</em>to the equation<em>Su = Rz</em>to be continuously dependent on<em>z</em>are given. These conditions are used to study the continuity of minimum energy and linear-quadratic control problems for infinite dimensional linear systems with fixed endpoints.
