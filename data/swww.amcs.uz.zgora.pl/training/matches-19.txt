On the dynamics of a chemostat model with delayed nutrient recycling
Paolo Fergola, Liqiang Jiang, Zhien Ma
This paper studies the dynamics of a chemostat model with<em>n</em>populations competing for one nutrient which can be recycled due to decomposition of dead biomass. Several kinds of results about local and global stability of non-negative equilibria, uniform persistence and control of populations are obtained.
