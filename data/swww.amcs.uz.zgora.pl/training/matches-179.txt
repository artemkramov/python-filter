State estimation for MISO non-linear systems in controller canonical form
Benoît Schwaller, Denis Ensminger, Birgitta Dresp-Langley, José Ragot
We propose a new observer where the model, decomposed in generalized canonical form of regulation described by Fliess, is dissociated from the part assuring error correction. The obtained stable exact estimates give direct access to state variables in the form of successive derivatives. The dynamic response of the observer converges exponentially, as long as the nonlinearities are locally of Lipschitz type. In this case, we demonstrate that a quadratic Lyapunov function provides a number of inequalities which guarantee at least local stability. A synthesis of gains is proposed, independent of the observation time scale. Simulations of a Düffing system and a Lorenz strange attractor illustrate theoretical developments.
