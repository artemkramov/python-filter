Pointwise completeness and pointwise degeneracy of positive fractional descriptor continuous-time linear systems with regular pencils
Tadeusz Kaczorek
Pointwise completeness and pointwise degeneracy of positive fractional descriptor continuous-time linear systems with regular pencils are addressed. Conditions for pointwise completeness and pointwise degeneracy of the systems are established and illustrated by an example.
