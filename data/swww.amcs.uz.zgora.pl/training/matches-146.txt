Fractional descriptor continuous-time linear systems described by the Caputo–Fabrizio derivative
Tadeusz Kaczorek, Kamil Borawski
The Weierstrass–Kronecker theorem on the decomposition of the regular pencil is extended to fractional descriptor continuous-time linear systems described by the Caputo–Fabrizio derivative. A method for computing solutions of continuous-time systems is presented. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the positivity and stability of these systems are established. The discussion is illustrated with a numerical example.
