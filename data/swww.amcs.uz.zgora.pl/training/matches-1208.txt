Minimal realization for positive multivariable linear systems with delay
Tadeusz Kaczorek, Mikołaj Busłowicz
The realization problem for positive multivariable discrete-time systems with one time delay is formulated and solved. Conditions for the solvability of the realization problem are established. A procedure for the computation of a minimal positive realization of a proper rational matrix is presented and illustrated by an example.
