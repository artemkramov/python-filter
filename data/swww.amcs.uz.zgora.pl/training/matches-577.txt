A robust computational technique for a system of singularly perturbed reaction–diffusion equations
Vinod Kumar, Rajesh K. Bawa, Arvind K. Lal
In this paper, a singularly perturbed system of reaction–diffusion Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) is examined. To solve such a type of problems, a Modified Initial Value Technique (MIVT) is proposed on an appropriate piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh. The MIVT is shown to be of second order convergent (up to a logarithmic factor). Numerical results are presented which are in agreement with the theoretical results.
