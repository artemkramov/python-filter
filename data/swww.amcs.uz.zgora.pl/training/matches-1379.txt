Elimination of finite eigenvalues of the 2D Roesser model by state feedbacks
Tadeusz Kaczorek
A new problem of decreasing the degree of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial of the 2D Roesser model by a suitable choice of state feedbacks is formulated. Sufficient conditions are established under which it is possible to choose state feedbacks such that the non-zero closed-loop characteristic polynomial has degree zero. A procedure for computation of the feedback gain matrices is presented and illustrated by a numerical example.
