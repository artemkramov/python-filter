On a regularization method for variational inequalities with<em>P</em><sub>0</sub>mappings
Igor Konnov, Elena Mazurkevich, Mohamed Ali
We consider partial Browder-Tikhonov regularization techniques for variational inequality problems with<em>P</em><sub>0</sub>cost mappings and box-constrained feasible sets. We present classes of economic equilibrium problems which satisfy such assumptions and propose a regularization method for these problems.
