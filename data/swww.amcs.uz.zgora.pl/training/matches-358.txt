Application of a Boltzmann machine to timetable design
Konrad Piwakowski, Marek Trojanowicz
This paper contains a description of the construction of a Boltzmann machine that can be applied to obtain a class-teacher timetable. In particular, this approach concerns requirements that are characteristic to primary and secondary schools. The conditions of asymptotic convergence to an optimal solution are presented.
