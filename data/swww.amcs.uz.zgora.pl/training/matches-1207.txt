An infinite horizon predictive control algorithm based on multivariable input-output models
Maciej Ławryńczuk, Piotr Tatjewski
In this paper an infinite horizon predictive control algorithm, for which closed loop stability is guaranteed, is developed in the framework of multivariable linear input-output models. The original infinite dimensional optimisation problem is transformed into a finite dimensional one with a penalty term. In the unconstrained case the stabilising control law, using a numerically reliable SVD decomposition, is derived as an analytical formula, calculated off-line. Considering constraints needs solving on-line a quadratic programming problem. Additionally, it is shown how free and forced responses can be calculated without the necessity of solving a matrix Diophantine equation.
