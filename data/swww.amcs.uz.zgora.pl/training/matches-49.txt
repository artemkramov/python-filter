EHMAC – A new simple tool for robust linear multivariable control
Krzysztof J. Latawiec, Ryszard Rojek
A combination of long range predictive control-originated EHPC and internal model control-structured MAC is shown to produce a new, simple but effective Extended Horizon Model Algorithmic Control (EHMAC). The EHMAC strategy can be used to robustly control open-loop stable non-minimum phase (possibly non-square) MIMO systems under very large model-plant mismatches. Robust EHMAC design is made straightforward by means of a separate selection of a single prediction horizon and an IMC filter parameter, which can be easily auto-tuned.
