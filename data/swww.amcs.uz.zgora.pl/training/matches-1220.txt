Advances in parallel heterogeneous genetic algorithms for continuous optimization
Enrique Alba, Francisco Luna, Antonio J. Nebro
In this paper we address an extension of a very efficient genetic algorithm (GA) known as<em>Hy3</em>, a physical parallelization of the gradual distributed real-coded GA (GD-RCGA). This search model relies on a set of eight subpopulations residing in a cube topology having two faces for promoting exploration and exploitation. The resulting technique has been shown to yield very accurate results in continuous optimization by using crossover operators tuned to explore and exploit the solutions inside each subpopulation. We introduce here a further extension of<em>Hy3</em>, called<em>Hy4</em>, that uses 16 islands arranged in a hypercube of four dimensions. Thus, two new faces with different exploration/exploitation search capabilities are added to the search performed by<em>Hy3</em>. We analyze the importance of running a synchronous versus an asynchronous version of the models considered. The results indicate that the proposed<em>Hy4</em>model overcomes the<em>Hy3</em>performance because of its improved balance between exploration and exploitation that enhances the search. Finally, we also show that the async<em>Hy4</em>model scales better than the sync one.
