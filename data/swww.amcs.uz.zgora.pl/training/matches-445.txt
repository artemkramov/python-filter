Stabilization of an epidemic model via an<em>N</em>-periodic approach
Begoña Cantó, Carmen Coll, Elena Sánchez
We analyze the evolution of an infectious disease by combining different groups of a population when the route of transmission is via encounters with free-living virulent organisms that can survive for a long time outside the individual. This study involves matrix analysis of lower triangular block matrices and some of their spectral properties. We propose an<em>N</em>-periodic control strategy in order to stabilize the disease around the disease-free equilibrium point.
