An extension of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for a standard pair of block matrices
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is extended for a standard pair of matrices partitioned into blocks that commute in pairs. The Victoria theorem (Victoria, 1982) is a particular case for<em>E = I</em>of the extended Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The new theorem is illustrated by an example. Some remarks on extension of the theorem for non-square block matrices are also given.
