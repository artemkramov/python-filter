Positivity and linearization of a class of nonlinear continuous-time systems by state feedbacks
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The positivity and linearization of a class of nonlinear continuous-time system by nonlinear state feedbacks are addressed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the positivity of the class of nonlinear systems are established. A method for linearization of nonlinear systems by nonlinear state feedbacks is presented. It is shown that by a suitable choice of the state feedback it is possible to obtain an asymptotically stable and controllable linear system, and if the closed-loop system is positive then it is unstable.
