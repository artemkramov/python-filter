On attaining the prescribed quality of a controlled fourth order system
Vladimir Kapustyan, Vyacheslav Maksimov
In this paper, we discuss a method of auxiliary controlled models and its application to solving some robust control problems for a system described by differential equations. As an illustration, a system of nonlinear differential equations of the fourth order is used. A solution algorithm, which is stable with respect to informational noise and computational errors, is presented. The algorithm is based on a combination of online state/input reconstruction and feedback control methods.
