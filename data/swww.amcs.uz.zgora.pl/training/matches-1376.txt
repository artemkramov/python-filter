Regional detection and reconstruction of unknown internal or boundary sources
Larbi Afifi, Abdelhaq El Jai, Malika Merry
The purpose of this paper is to study the problem of regional detection, to characterize internal or boundary regionally detectable sources and regionally spy sensors, and to establish a relationship between these sensors and regionally strategic sensors. It is shown how to reconstruct a regionally detectable internal or a boundary source from a given output, with an extension to the case when the output is affected by an observation error. Numerical results are given in the case of a diffusion system.
