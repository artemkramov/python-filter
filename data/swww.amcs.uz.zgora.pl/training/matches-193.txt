Parameter identification in robot control
Carsten Schmidt, Martin Prüfer
This paper discusses practical problems of robot dynamics identification. The problems as well as possible solutions are illustrated by records from an experimental direct drive arm and a geared industrial robot. Questions regarding measurement noise, biased estimates, poor identifiability conditions, and the concepts of on-line and off-line identification are also discussed. The main contributions of the paper are a computationally cheap procedure for on-line identifiability supervision and a scheme which permits to reduce the bias of the least-squares estimator.
