A comparative and experimental study on gradient and genetic optimization algorithms for parameter identification of linear MIMO models of a drilling vessel
Stanisław Bańka, Michał Brasel, Paweł Dworak, Krzysztof Jaroszewski
The paper presents algorithms for parameter identification of linear vessel models being in force for the current operating point of a ship. Advantages and disadvantages of gradient and genetic algorithms in identifying the model parameters are discussed. The study is supported by presentation of identification results for a nonlinear model of a drilling vessel.
