Non-optimal behaviour of finite element methods for first order hyperbolic problems
Todd E. Peterson, David B. Shuster
We investigate two explicit finite element methods for linear scalar first order hyperbolic equations, one using a continuous piecewise-polynomial approximation and one using a discontinuous approximation. Several aspects of the performance of these methods are considered; in particular, the sharpness of some existing error estimates, and crosswind spread estimates. For the discontinuous method, we give a new error estimate for the case of piecewise-constants.
