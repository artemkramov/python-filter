Dynamical identification of controls for parabolic variational inequalities
Vycheslav I. Maksimov
The reconstruction problems of the unknown parameters based on the available information is one of the fundamental problems in the field of optimal control. This paper presents a new method of the positional modelling of distributed controls for the system described by the parabolic variational inequalities.
