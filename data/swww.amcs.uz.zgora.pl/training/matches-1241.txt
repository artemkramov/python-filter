Parameters identification of material models based on the inverse analysis
Danuta Szeliga, Jerzy Gawąd, Maciej Pietrzyk
The paper presents an application of the inverse analysis to the identification of two models: a phase transformation model and a rheological model. The optimization algorithm for the inverse analysis was tested for various techniques of searching for the minimum: derivative-free and gradient methods, as well as genetic algorithms. Simulation results were validated for microalloyed niobium steel. An optimization strategy, which is adequate for the inverse analysis, is suggested.
