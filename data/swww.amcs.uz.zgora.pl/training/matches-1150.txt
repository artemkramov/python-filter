Output stabilization for infinite-dimensional bilinear systems
El Hassan Zerrik, Mohamed Ouzahra
The purpose of this paper is to extend results on regional internal stabilization for infinite bilinear systems to the case where the subregion of interest is a part of the boundary of the system evolution domain. Then we characterize either stabilizing control on a boundary part, or the one minimizing a given cost of performance. The obtained results are illustrated with numerical examples.
