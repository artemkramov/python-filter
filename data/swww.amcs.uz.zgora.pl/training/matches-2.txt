The control of drilling vibrations: A coupled PDE-ODE modeling approach
Belem Saldivar, Sabine Mondié, Juan Carlos Ávila Vilchis
The main purpose of this contribution is the control of both torsional and axial vibrations occurring along a rotary oilwell drilling system. The model considered consists of a wave equation coupled to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) through a nonlinear function describing the rock–bit interaction. We propose a systematic method to design feedback controllers guaranteeing ultimate boundedness of the system trajectories and leading consequently to the suppression of harmful dynamics. The proposal of a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional provides stability conditions stated in terms of the solution of a set of linear and bilinear matrix inequalities (LMIs, BMIs). Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency of the obtained control laws.
