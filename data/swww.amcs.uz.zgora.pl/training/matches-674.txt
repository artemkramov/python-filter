Epoch-incremental reinforcement learning algorithms
Roman Zajdel
In this article, a new class of the epoch-incremental reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. In the incremental mode, the fundamental TD(0) or TD(λ) algorithm is performed and an environment model is created. In the epoch mode, on the basis of the environment model, the distances of past-active states to the terminal state are computed. These distances and the reinforcement terminal state signal are used to improve the agent policy.
