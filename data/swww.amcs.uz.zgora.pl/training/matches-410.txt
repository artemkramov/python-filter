Automated realization of Boolean algebra theorems in the simplification of logical expressions
Janusz Szajna
This paper presents an approach to the automation of symbolic transformation and simplification of complex logical expressions. The transformation is performed with the aid of Prolog – one of the two programming languages being used for artificial intelligence. Due to the declarative nature of Prolog the specification of a particular theorem together with its variations becomes its realization at the same time. Moreover, each predicate is a direct reflection of a heuristic way of the expressions transformations, written in Prolog convention.
