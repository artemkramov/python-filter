Implication-based neuro-fuzzy architectures
Danuta Rutkowska, Robert Nowicki
This paper presents connectionist multi-layer architectures of neuro-fuzzy systems based on various fuzzy implications. The well-known Mamdani approach (constructive) and the logical approach (destructive) are considered. Two kinds of architectures, a simpler and a more general one, are distinguished. Examples of application to classification and control problems are provided.
