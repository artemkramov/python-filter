Reduced-order fractional descriptor observers for a class of fractional descriptor continuous-time nonlinear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
Fractional descriptor reduced-order nonlinear observers for a class of fractional descriptor continuous-time nonlinear systems are proposed. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the observers are established. The design procedure for the observers is given and demonstrated on a numerical example.
