Software reliability growth modeling for agile software development
Shubham Rawat, Nupur Goyal, Mangey Ram
The frequent incremental release of software in agile development impacts the overall reliability of the product. In this paper, we propose a generic software reliability model for the agile process, taking permanent and transient faults into consideration. The proposed model is implemented using the NHPP (non-homogenous Poisson process) and the Musa model. The comparison of the two implementations yields an effective, empirical and reliable model for agile software development.
