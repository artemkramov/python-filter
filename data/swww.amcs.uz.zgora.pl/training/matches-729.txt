Computer methods for stability analysis of the Roesser type model of 2D continuous-discrete linear systems
Mikołaj Busłowicz, Andrzej Ruszewski
Asymptotic stability of models of 2D continuous-discrete linear systems is considered. Computer methods for investigation of the asymptotic stability of the Roesser type model are given. The methods require computation of eigenvalue-loci of complex matrices or evaluation of complex functions. The effectiveness of the stability tests is demonstrated on numerical examples.
