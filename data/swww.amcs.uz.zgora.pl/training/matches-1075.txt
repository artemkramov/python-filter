The choice of the forms of Lyapunov functions for a positive 2D Roesser model
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The appropriate choice of the forms of Lyapunov functions for a positive 2D Roesser model is addressed. It is shown that for the positive 2D Roesser model: (i) a linear form of the state vector can be chosen as a Lyapunov function, (ii) there exists a strictly positive diagonal matrix<em>P</em>such that the matrix<em>A<sup>T</sup>P A − P</em>is negative definite. The theoretical deliberations will be illustrated by numerical examples.
