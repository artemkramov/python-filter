Controlling a non-homogeneous Timoshenko beam with the aid of the torque
Grigory M. Sklyar, Grzegorz Szkibiel
Considered is the control and stabilizability of a slowly rotating non-homogeneous Timoshenko beam with the aid of a torque. It turns out that the beam is (approximately) controllable with the aid of the torque if and only if it is (approximately) controllable. However, the controllability problem appears to be a side-effect while studying the stabilizability. To build a stabilizing control one needs to go through the methods of correcting the operators with functionals so that they have finally the appropriate form and the results on<em>C</em><sup>0</sup>-continuous semigroups may be applied.
