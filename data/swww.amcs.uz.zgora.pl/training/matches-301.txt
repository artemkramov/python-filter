A dynamically adaptive lattice Boltzmann method for thermal convection problems

Utilizing the Boussinesq approximation, a double-population incompressible thermal lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for forced and natural convection in two and three space dimensions is developed and validated. A block-structured dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) procedure tailored for the LBM is applied to enable computationally efficient simulations of moderate to high Rayleigh number flows which are characterized by a large scale disparity in boundary layers and free stream flow. As test cases, the analytically accessible problem of a two-dimensional (2D) forced convection flow through two porous plates and the non-Cartesian configuration of a heated rotating cylinder are considered. The objective of the latter is to advance the boundary conditions for an accurate treatment of curved boundaries and to demonstrate the effect on the solution. The effectiveness of the overall approach is demonstrated for the natural convection benchmark of a 2D cavity with differentially heated walls at Rayleigh numbers from 10<sup>3</sup>up to 10<sup>8</sup>. To demonstrate the benefit of the employed AMR procedure for three-dimensional (3D) problems, results from the natural convection in a cubic cavity at Rayleigh numbers from 10<sup>3</sup>up to 10<sup>5</sup>are compared with benchmark results.
