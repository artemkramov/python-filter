On 2-D polynomials and discrete-continuous systems
Zdzisław W. Trzaska
The paper deals with 2-D polynomials<em>Q(x, y)</em>and<em>R(x, y)</em>having real coefficients, which are generated by modified first and second numerical triangles (FMNT) and (SMNT), respectively. It has been proven that<em>n</em>-th-degree polynomials<em>Q<sub>n</sub>(X, y)</em>and<em>R<sub>n</sub>(x, y)</em>can be easily determined as solutions of third order recurrences with coefficients depending on x and y with appropriate initial conditions. Suitable expressions are involved and simple formulae are established to check links between<em>Q(x, y)</em>and<em>R(x, y)</em>. Problems connected to the efficiency of the 2-D polynomials in solutions to practical problems are also considered. Examples illustrating possible applications of the presented approach are also demonstrated.
