Note onset detection in musical signals via neural-network-based multi-ODF fusion

The problem of note onset detection in musical signals is considered. The proposed solution is based on known approaches in which an<em>onset detection function</em>is defined on the basis of spectral characteristics of audio data. In our approach, several onset detection functions are used simultaneously to form an input vector for a multi-layer non-linear perceptron, which learns to detect onsets in the training data. This is in contrast to standard methods based on thresholding the onset detection functions with a moving average or a moving median. Our approach is also different from most of the current machine-learning-based solutions in that we explicitly use the onset detection functions as an intermediate representation, which may therefore be easily replaced with a different one, e.g., to match the characteristics of a particular audio data source. The results obtained for a database containing annotated onsets for 17 different instruments and ensembles are compared with state-of-the-art solutions.
