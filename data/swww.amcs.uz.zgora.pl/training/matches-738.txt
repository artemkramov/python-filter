An approach to the analysis of observability and controllability in nonlinear systems via linear methods
Alexey Zhirabok, Alexey Shumsky
The paper is devoted to the problem of observability and controllability analysis in nonlinear dynamic systems. Both continuous- and discrete-time systems described by nonlinear differential or difference equations, respectively, are considered. A new approach is developed to solve this problem whose features include (i) consideration of systems with non-differentiable nonlinearities and (ii) the use of relatively simple linear methods which may be supported by existing programming systems, e.g., Matlab. Sufficient conditions are given for nonlinear unobservability/uncontrollability analysis. To apply these conditions, one isolates the linear part of the system which is checked to be unobservable/uncontrollable and, if the answer is positive, it is examined whether or not existing nonlinear terms violate the unobservability/uncontrollability property.
