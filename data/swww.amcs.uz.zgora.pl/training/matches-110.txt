Feedback stabilization of continuous systems by adding an integrator
R. Outbib, W. Aggoune
This note is devoted to the problem of global stabilization of continuous systems by adding an integrator. The goal is to prove that if a continuous non-linear system<em>x = f(x, u)</em>is globally asymptotically stable at the origin for<em>u</em>≡ 0, then the augmented system obtained by adding an integrator is stabilizable by means of a continuous feedback.
