Reproducing kernels and Riccati equations
Harry Dym
The purpose of this paper is to exhibit a connection between the Hermitian solutions of matrix Riccati equations and a class of finite dimensional reproducing kernel Krein spaces. This connection is then exploited to obtain minimal factorizations of rational matrix valued functions that are<em>J</em>-unitary on the imaginary axis in a natural way.
