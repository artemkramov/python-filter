Controllability of nonlinear discrete systems
Jerzy Klamka
Local constrained controllability problems for nonlinear finite-dimensional discrete 1-D and 2-D control systems with constant coefficients are formulated and discussed. Using some mapping theorems taken from nonlinear functional analysis and linear approximation methods, sufficient conditions for constrained controllability in bounded domains are derived and proved. The paper extends the controllability conditions with unconstrained controls given in the literature to cover both 1-D and 2-D nonlinear discrete systems with constrained controls.
