Realization problem for positive multivariable discrete-time linear systems with delays in the state vector and inputs
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The realization problem for positive multivariable discrete-time systems with delays in the state and inputs is formulated and solved. Conditions for its solvability and the existence of a minimal positive realization are established. A procedure for the computation of a positive realization of a proper rational matrix is presented and illustrated with examples.
