Fault detection in nonlinear systems via linear methods
Alexey Zhirabok, Alexey Shumsky, Sergey Solyanik, Alexey Suvorov
The problem of robust linear and nonlinear diagnostic observer design is considered. A method is suggested to construct the observers that are disturbance decoupled or have minimal sensitivity to the disturbances. The method is based on a logic-dynamic approach which allows us to consider systems with non-differentiable nonlinearities in the state equations by methods of linear algebra.
