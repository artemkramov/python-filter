Bifurcation and control for a discrete-time prey–predator model with Holling-IV functional response
Qiaoling Chen, Zhidong Teng, Zengyun Hu
The dynamics of a discrete-time predator–prey model with Holling-IV functional response are investigated. It is shown that the model undergoes a flip bifurcation, a Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node bifurcation by using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations not only exhibit our results with the theoretical analysis, but also show the complex dynamical behaviors, such as the period-3, 6, 9, 12, 20, 63, 70, 112 orbits, a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations in period-2, 4, 8, 16, quasi-periodic orbits, an attracting invariant circle, an inverse period-doubling bifurcation from the period-32 orbit leading to chaos and a boundary crisis, a sudden onset of chaos and a sudden disappearance of the chaotic dynamics, attracting chaotic sets and non-attracting sets. We also observe that when the prey is in chaotic dynamics the predator can tend to extinction or to a stable equilibrium. Specifically, we stabilize the chaotic orbits at an unstable fixed point by using OGY chaotic control.
