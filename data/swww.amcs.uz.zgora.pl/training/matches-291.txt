On the existence of an optimally failure tolerant 7R manipulator Jacobian
Anthony A. Maciejewski, Rodney G. Roberts
Kinematically redundant manipulators have been proposed for use in remote or hazardous environments due to their potential for tolerance to joint failures. This article defines a local measure of failure tolerance based on the worst-case dexterity following a locked joint failure. Optimal values of this measure are identified and related to the required structure of a Jacobian matrix. It is shown that it is trivial to derive manipulator configurations that correspond to the desired Jacobians with the single exception of a manipulator with seven rotational joints that is required to perform tasks which require fully general linear and rotational velocities of the end effector.
