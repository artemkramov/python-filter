Applications of neural-type structured networks for solving algebraic matrix equations and computation of the Drazin inverse
Andrzej Cichocki, Tadeusz Kaczorek
An overview of the methods of solving algebraic matrix equations and computation of the Drazin inverse of a singular matrix with the use of neural-type structured networks is presented. Algebraic matrix equations of the form<em>A<sub>1</sub>XB<sub>1</sub>+ A<sub>2</sub>XB<sub>2</sub>+ ... + A<sub>n</sub>XB<sub>n</sub>= C</em>and the algebraic Riccati equation<em>A<sup>T</sup>X + XA - XWX + Q = 0</em>with one unknown matrix<em>X</em>and the matrix equations<em>AX - YB = C</em>with two unknown matrices<em>X, Y</em>are considered. An extension for polynomial matrix equations of the form<em>AXB = C</em>is also presented. The presented algorithms are based on the gradient optimization technique and the standard back-propagation learning algorithm.
