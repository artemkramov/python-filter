Sender-equivocable encryption schemes secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks revisited
Zhengan Huang, Shengli Liu, Baodong Qin, Kefei Chen
Fehr<em>et al.</em>(2010) proposed the first sender-equivocable encryption scheme secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks (NCCCA) and proved that NC-CCA security implies security against selective opening chosen-ciphertext attacks (SO-CCA). The NC-CCA security proof of the scheme relies on security against substitution attacks of a new primitive, the “cross-authentication code”. However, the security of the cross-authentication code cannot be guaranteed when all the keys used in the code are exposed. Our key observation is that, in the NC-CCA security game, the randomness used in the generation of the challenge ciphertext is exposed to the adversary. Based on this observation, we provide a security analysis of Fehr<em>et al.</em>'s scheme, showing that its NC-CCA security proof is flawed. We also point out that the scheme of Fehr<em>et al</em>. encrypting a single-bit plaintext can be refined to achieve NC-CCA security, free of the cross-authentication code. Furthermore, we propose the notion of “strong cross-authentication code”, apply it to Fehr<em>et al.</em>'s scheme, and show that the new version of the latter achieves NC-CCA security for multi-bit plaintexts.
