Reducing the mast vibration of single-mast stacker cranes by gain-scheduled control
Sándor Hajdu, Péter Gáspár
In the frame structure of stacker cranes harmful mast vibrations may appear due to the inertial forces of acceleration or the braking movement phase. This effect may reduce the stability and positioning accuracy of these machines. Unfortunately, their dynamic properties also vary with the lifted load magnitude and position. The purpose of the paper is to present a controller design method which can handle the effect of a varying lifted load magnitude and position in a dynamic model and at the same time reveals good reference signal tracking and mast vibration reducing properties. A controller design case study is presented step by step from dynamic modeling through to the validation of the resulting controller. In the paper the dynamic modeling possibilities of single-mast stacker cranes are summarized. The handling of varying dynamical behavior is realized via the polytopic LPV modeling approach. Based on this modeling technique, a gain-scheduled controller design method is proposed, which is suitable for achieving the goals set. Finally, controller validation is presented by means of time domain simulations.
