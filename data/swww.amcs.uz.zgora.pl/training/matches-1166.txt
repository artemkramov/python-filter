Positivity and stability of fractional descriptor time-varying discrete-time linear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The Weierstrass–Kronecker theorem on the decomposition of the regular pencil is extended to fractional descriptor time-varying discrete-time linear systems. A method for computing solutions of fractional systems is proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the positivity of these systems are established.
