Can interestingness measures be usefully visualized?
Robert Susmaga, Izabela Szczęch
The paper presents visualization techniques for interestingness measures. The process of measure visualization provides useful insights into different domain areas of the visualized measures and thus effectively assists their comprehension and selection for different knowledge discovery tasks. Assuming a common domain form of the visualized measures, a set of contingency tables, which consists of all possible tables having the same total number of observations, is constructed. These originally four-dimensional data may be effectively represented in three dimensions using a tetrahedron-based barycentric coordinate system. At the same time, an additional, scalar function of the data (referred to as the operational function, e.g., any interestingness measure) may be rendered using colour. Throughout the paper a particular group of interestingness measures, known as confirmation measures, is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the visualization techniques. They cover a wide spectrum of possibilities, ranging from the determination of specific values (extremes, zeros, etc.) of a single measure, to the localization of pre-defined regions of interest, e.g., such domain areas for which two or more measures do not differ at all or differ the most.
