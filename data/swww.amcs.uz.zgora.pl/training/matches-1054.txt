A family of model predictive control algorithms with artificial neural networks
Maciej Ławryńczuk
This paper details nonlinear Model-based Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms for MIMO processes modelled by means of neural networks of a feedforward structure. Two general MPC techniques are considered: the one with Nonlinear Optimisation (MPC-NO) and the one with Nonlinear Prediction and Linearisation (MPC-NPL). In the first case a nonlinear optimisation problem is solved in real time on-line. In order to reduce the computational burden, in the second case a neural model of the process is used on-line to determine local linearisation and a nonlinear free trajectory. Single-point and multi-point linearisation methods are discussed. The MPC-NPL structure is far more reliable and less computationally demanding in comparison with the MPC-NO one because it solves a quadratic programming problem, which can be done efficiently within a foreseeable time frame. At the same time, closed-loop performance of both algorithm classes is similar. Finally, a hybrid MPC algorithm with Nonlinear Prediction, Linearisation and Nonlinear optimisation (MPC-NPL-NO) is discussed.
