Computer aided design of mechatronic systems
Zbigniew Mrozek
Any successful company must react quickly to changing trends in the market. New products should be designed and manufactured quicker and cheaper than counter partners do. A shorter design time provides a distinct competitive advantage. The paper describes two approaches towards designing interdisciplinary mechatronic systems: the first is visual modeling with the UML, the second is physical modelling with Modelica.
