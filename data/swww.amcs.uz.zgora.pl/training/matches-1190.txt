Infinite eigenvalue assignment by an output feedback for singular systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The problem of an infinite eigenvalue assignment by an output feedback is considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are established. A procedure for the computation of the output-feedback gain matrix is given and illustrated with a numerical example.
