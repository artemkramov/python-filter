Decentralized design of interconnected<em>H<sub>∞</sub></em>feedback control systems with quantized signals
Guisheng Zhai, Ning Chen, Weihua Gui
In this paper, we consider the design of interconnected<em>H<sub>∞</sub></em>feedback control systems with quantized signals. We assume that a decentralized dynamic output feedback has been designed for an interconnected continuous-time LTI system so that the closed-loop system is stable and a desired<em>H<sub>∞</sub></em>disturbance attenuation level is achieved, and that the subsystem measurement outputs are quantized before they are passed to the local controllers. We propose a local-output-dependent strategy for updating the parameters of the quantizers, so that the overall closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and achieves the same<em>H<sub>∞</sub></em>disturbance attenuation level. Both the pre-designed controllers and the parameters of the quantizers are constructed in a decentralized manner, depending on local measurement outputs.
