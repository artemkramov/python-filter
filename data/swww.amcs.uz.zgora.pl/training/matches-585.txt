A multi-server queueing system with two types of customers and an infinite buffer operating in a random environment as a model of a contact center is investigated. The arrival flow of customers is described by a marked Markovian arrival process. Type 1 customers have a non-preemptive priority over type 2 customers and can leave the buffer due to a lack of service. The service times of different type customers have a phase-type distribution with different parameters. To facilitate the investigation of the system we use a generalized phase-type service time distribution. The criterion of ergodicity for a multi-dimensional Markov chain describing the behavior of the system and the algorithm for computation of its steady-state distribution are outlined. Some key performance measures are calculated. The Laplace–Stieltjes transforms of the sojourn and waiting time distributions of priority and non-priority customers are derived. A numerical example illustrating the importance of taking into account the correlation in the arrival process is presented.
