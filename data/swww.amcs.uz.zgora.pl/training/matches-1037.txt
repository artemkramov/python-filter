Fault tolerant control design for polytopic LPV systems
Mickael Rodrigues, Didier Theilliol, Samir Aberkane, Dominique Sauter
This paper deals with a Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) strategy for polytopic Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems. The main contribution consists in the design of a Static Output Feedback (SOF) dedicated to such systems in the presence of multiple actuator faults/failures. The controllers are synthesized through Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) in both fault-free and faulty cases in order to preserve the system closed-loop stability. Hence, this paper provides a new sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the solvability of the stabilizing output feedback control problem. An example illustrates the effectiveness and performances of the proposed FTC method.
