A new perspective on controllability properties for dynamical systems
Paula Rocha, Jeffrey Wood
In this paper, we study the properties of weak and strong controllability as newly defined in (Rocha, 1995) for delay-differential systems in a behavioural setting, now for the multidimensional case. Further, we give an overview of the relationships between these properties and the original behavioural controllability concept introduced in (Willems, 1988).
