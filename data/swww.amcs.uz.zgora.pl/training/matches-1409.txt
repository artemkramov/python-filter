Externally and internally positive time-varying linear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The notions of externally and internally positive time-varying linear systems are introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the external and internal positivities of time-varying linear systems are established. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the reachability of internally positive time-varying linear systems are presented.
