Verified methods for computing Pareto sets: General algorithmic analysis
Boglárka G.-Tóth, Vladik Kreinovich
In many engineering problems, we face multi-objective optimization, with several objective functions<em>f<sub>1</sub>, . . . , f<sub>n</sub></em>. We want to provide the user with the Pareto set—a set of all possible solutions x which cannot be improved in all categories (i.e., for which<em>f<sub>j</sub>(x’) ≥ f<sub>j</sub>(x)</em>for all<em>j</em>and<em>f<sub>j</sub>(x’) &gt; f<sub>j</sub>(x)</em>for some<em>j</em>is impossible). The user should be able to select an appropriate trade-off between, say, cost and durability. We extend the general results about (verified) algorithmic computability of maxima locations to show that Pareto sets can also be computed.
