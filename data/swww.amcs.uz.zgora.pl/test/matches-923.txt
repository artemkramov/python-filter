Reachability of cone fractional continuous-time linear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
A new class of cone fractional continuous-time linear systems is introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a fractional linear system to be a cone fractional one are established. Sufficient conditions for the reachability of cone fractional systems are given. The discussion is illustrated with an example of linear cone fractional systems.
