A comparative study on interval arithmetic operations with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers for solving an intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective linear programming problem
Rajendran Vidhya, Rajkumar Irene Hepzibah
In a real world situation, whenever ambiguity exists in the modeling of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs), interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) are often used in order to represent a range of IFNs unstable from the most pessimistic evaluation to the most optimistic one. IVIFNs are a construction which helps us to avoid such a prohibitive complexity. This paper is focused on two types of arithmetic operations on interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) to solve the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective linear programming problem with pentagonal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (PIFNs) by assuming different<em>α</em>and<em>β</em>cut values in a comparative manner. The objective functions involved in the problem are ranked by the ratio ranking method and the problem is solved by the preemptive optimization method. An illustrative example with MATLAB outputs is presented in order to clarify the potential approach.
