The form of topological derivatives for an integral shape functional is derived for a class of semilinear elliptic equations. The convergence of finite element approximation for the topological derivatives is shown and the error estimates in the<em>L<sup>∞</sup></em>norm are obtained. The results of numerical experiments which confirm the theoretical convergence rate are presented.
