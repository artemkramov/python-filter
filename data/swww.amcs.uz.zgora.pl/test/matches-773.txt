Novel fault detection criteria based on linear quadratic control performances
Dušan Krokavec, Anna Filasová
This paper proposes a new approach to designing a relatively simple algorithmic fault detection system that is potentially applicable in embedded diagnostic structures. The method blends the LQ control principle with checking and evaluating unavoidable degradation in the sequence of discrete-time LQ control performance index values due to faults in actuators, sensors or system dynamics. Design conditions are derived, and direct computational forms of the algorithms are given. A simulation example subject to different types of failures is used to illustrate the design process and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
