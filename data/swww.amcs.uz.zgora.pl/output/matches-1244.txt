Connections between object classification criteria using an ultrasonic bi-sonar system
Bogdan Kreczmer
The paper presents connections between the criteria which make three types of objects possible to be recognized, namely, edges, planes and corners. These criteria can be applied while a binaural sonar system is used. It is shown that the criteria are specific forms of a general equation. The form of the equation depends on a single coefficient. In the paper, the meaning of this coefficient is discussed. The constructions of the arrangement of objects are presented and are bound with values of the coefficient.
