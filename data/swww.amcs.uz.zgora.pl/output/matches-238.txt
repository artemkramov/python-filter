Mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of induction heating processes
Jacques Rappaz, Marek Świerkosz
This paper deals with numerical simulation of induction heating for tridimensional time-varying axisymmetric geometries. A mathematical model is presented together with the numerical scheme used to solve it. The whole is illustrated by results of sample computations.
