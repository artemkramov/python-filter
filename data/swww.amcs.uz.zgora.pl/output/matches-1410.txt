Robust LQR and LQI control with actuator failure of a 2DOF unmanned bicycle robot stabilized by an inertial wheel
Adam Owczarkowski, Dariusz Horla
Essential ingredients for robust control are the ability to cope with different types of system behavior following modeling imperfections and the ability to assure a certain performance level. In this paper, we propose to use an actuator fault-tolerant control law to govern, during experiments, the stabilization of a bicycle robot with an inertial wheel in order to take into account unmodeled uncertainty introduced by using a linearized model in an LQR fashion. Our proposal is illustrated by signal plots and the values of performance indices obtained from a set of experiments.
