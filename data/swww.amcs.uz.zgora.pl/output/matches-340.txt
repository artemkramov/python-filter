Mathematical methods for cell cycle analysis from flow cytometric DNA-BrdUrd distributions
Alessandro Bertuzzi, Alberto Gandolfi, Carmela Sinisgalli, Giuseppe Starace
The paper discusses some mathematical methods, presented in the literature or proposed by the authors, which aim at the estimation of cell kinetic parameters from DNA-BrdUrd distributions obtained by the pulse labelling technique. In particular, we give an expression for the time behaviour of the relative movement of BrdUrd-labelled undivided cells, that takes into account the variability of DNA synthesis rate across<em>S</em>phase.
