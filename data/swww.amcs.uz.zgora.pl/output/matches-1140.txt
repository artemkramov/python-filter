Uncertainty models of vision sensors in mobile robot positioning
Piotr Skrzypczyński
This paper discusses how uncertainty models of vision-based positioning sensors can be used to support the planning and optimization of positioning actions for mobile robots. Two sensor types are considered: a global vision with overhead cameras, and an on-board camera observing artificial landmarks. The developed sensor models are applied to optimize robot positioning actions in a distributed system of mobile robots and monitoring sensors, and to plan the sequence of actions for a robot cooperating with the external infrastructure supporting its navigation.
