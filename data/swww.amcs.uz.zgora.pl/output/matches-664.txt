Approximation of fractional positive stable continuous-time linear systems by fractional positive stable discrete-time systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
Fractional positive asymptotically stable continuous-time linear systems are approximated by fractional positive asymptotically stable discrete-time systems using a linear Padé-type approximation. It is shown that the approximation preserves the positivity and asymptotic stability of the systems. An optional system approximation is also discussed.
