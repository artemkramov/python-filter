Existence and computation of the set of positive solutions to polynomial matrix equations
Tadeusz Kaczorek, Rafał Łopatka
Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the existence of positive solutions to polynomial diophatine equations. A method of computing of the set of positive solutions to a polynomial diophatine equation based on extreme points and extreme directions is proposed. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a numerical example.
