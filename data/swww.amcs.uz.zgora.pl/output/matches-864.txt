Sensors and boundary state reconstruction of hyperbolic systems
El Hassan Zerrik, Hamid Bourray, Samir Ben Hadid
This paper deals with the problem of regional observability of hyperbolic systems in the case where the subregion of interest is a boundary part of the system evolution domain. We give a definition and establish characterizations in connection with the sensor structure. Then we show that it is possible to reconstruct the system state on a subregion of the boundary. The developed approach, based on the Hilbert uniqueness method (Lions, 1988), leads to a reconstruction algorithm. The obtained results are illustrated with numerical examples and simulations.
