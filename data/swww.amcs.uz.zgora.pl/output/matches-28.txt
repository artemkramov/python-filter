Criteria for stability of uncertain linear systems with time-varying delay
Qing-Long Han, Keqin Gu
This paper focuses on the stability problem for uncertain linear systems with<em>time-varying</em>delays. Based on a<em>discretized Lyapunov functional</em>approach, delay-dependent criteria that are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities are proposed to guarantee asymptotic stability for such systems. Numerical examples are also included to show the effectiveness of the method.
