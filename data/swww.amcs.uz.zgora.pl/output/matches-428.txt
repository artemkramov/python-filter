On the number of actuators in parabolic systems
A. El Jai, S. El Yacoubi
Given a parabolic system defined on a bounded domain<em>n</em>and excited by a finite number of actuators, the purpose of this paper is to show that one actuator can achieve the controllability of the system. The method is based on a perturbation of the boundary of<em>n</em>.
