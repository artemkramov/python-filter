The paper presents the development of modelling and control strategies for a six-degree-of-freedom, unmanned combat aerial vehicle with the inclusion of the centre of gravity position travel during the straight-leg part of an in-flight refuelling manoeuvre. The centre of gravity position travel is found to have a parabolic variation with an increasing mass of aircraft. A nonlinear dynamic inversion-based neurocontroller is designed for the process under investigation. Three radial basis function neural networks are exploited in order to invert the dynamics of the system, one for each control channel. Modal and time-domain analysis results show that the dynamic properties of the aircraft are strongly influenced during aerial refuelling. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is demonstrated through the use of simulation results for an F-16 aircraft. The longitudinal neurocontroller provided interesting results, and performed better than a baseline nonlinear dynamic inversion controller without neural network. On the other hand, the lateral-directional nonlinear dynamic inversion-based neurocontroller did not perform well as the longitudinal controller. It was concluded that the nonlinear dynamic inversion-based neurocontroller could be applied to control an unmanned combat aerial vehicle during aerial refuelling.
