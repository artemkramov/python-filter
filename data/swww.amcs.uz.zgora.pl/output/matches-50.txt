Variable- and fixed-structure augmented interacting multiple-model algorithms for manoeuvring ship tracking based on new ship models
Emil Semerdjiev, Ludmila Mihaylova
Real-world tracking applications are related to a number of difficulties caused by the presence of different kinds of uncertainty, e.g. unknown or incompletely known system models and statistics of random processes or abrupt changes in the system modes of functioning. These problems are especially complicated in the marine navigation practice, where the commonly-used simple models of rectilinear or curvilinear target motions are not adequate for highly non-linear dynamics of the manoeuvring ship motion. A solution to these problems is to derive more suitable descriptions of real ship dynamics and to design adaptive estimation algorithms. After an analysis of basic hydrodynamic models, new ship models are derived in the paper. They are implemented in two versions of the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm which has become very popular recently. The first one is a standard IMM version based on fixed model structures (FS's). They represent various modes of ship motion, distinguished by their rates of turns. The same rate of turn is additionally adjusted in the proposed new augmented versions of the IMM (AIMM) algorithm by using FS's and variable structures (VS's) of adaptive models estimating the current change in the system control parameters. Monte Carlo simulation experiments indicate that the VS AIMM algorithm outperforms the FS AIMM and FS IMM ones with respect to both accuracy and adaptability.
