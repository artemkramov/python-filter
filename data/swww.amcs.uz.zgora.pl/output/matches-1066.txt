An active fault-tolerant control framework against actuator stuck failures under input saturations

In this paper, a control framework including active fault-tolerant control (FTC) and reference redesign is developed subject to actuator stuck failures under input saturations. FTC synthesis and reference redesign approaches are proposed to guarantee post-fault system safety and reference reachability. Then, these features are analyzed under both actuator stuck failures and constraints before fault-tolerant controller switches. As the main contribution, actuator stuck failures and constraints are unified so that they can be easily considered simultaneously. By means of transforming stuck failures into actuator constraints, the post-fault system can be regarded as an equivalent system with only asymmetrical actuator constraints. Thus, methods against actuator saturations can be used to guarantee regional stability and produce the stability region. Based on this region, stuck compensation is analyzed. Specifically, an unstable open-loop system is considered, which is more challenging. Furthermore, the method is extended to a set-point tracking problem where the reachability of the original reference can be evaluated. Then, a new optimal reference will be computed for the post-fault system if the original one is unreachable. Finally, simulation examples are shown to illustrate the theoretical results.
