Locally positive nonlinear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The notion of locally positive nonlinear time-varying linear systems is introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the local positiveness of nonlinear time-varying systems are established. The concept of local reachability in the direction of a cone is introduced, and sufficient conditions for local reachability in the direction of a cone of this class of nonlinear systems are presented.
