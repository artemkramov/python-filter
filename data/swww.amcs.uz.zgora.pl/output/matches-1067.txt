Arbitrary high-order finite element schemes and high-order mass lumping
Sébastien Jund, Stéphanie Salmon
Computers are becoming sufficiently powerful to permit to numerically solve problems such as the wave equation with high-order methods. In this article we will consider Lagrange finite elements of order<em>k</em>and show how it is possible to automatically generate the mass and stiffness matrices of any order with the help of symbolic computation software. We compare two high-order time discretizations: an explicit one using a Taylor expansion in time (a Cauchy-Kowalewski procedure) and an implicit Runge-Kutta scheme. We also construct in a systematic way a high-order quadrature which is optimal in terms of the number of points, which enables the use of mass lumping, up to<em>P</em>5 elements. We compare computational time and effort for several codes which are of high order in time and space and study their respective properties.
