Time-optimal boundary control of a parabolic system with time lags given in integral form
Adam Kowalewski, Anna Krakowiak
In this paper, the time-optimal boundary control problem for a distributed parabolic system in which time lags appear in integral form in both the state equation and the boundary condition is presented. Some particular properties of optimal control are discussed.
