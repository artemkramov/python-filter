Robust fault detection of singular LPV systems with multiple time-varying delays
Amir Hossein Hassanabadi, Masoud Shafiee, Vicenç Puig
In this paper, the robust fault detection problem for LPV singular delayed systems in the presence of disturbances and actuator faults is considered. For both disturbance decoupling and actuator fault detection, an unknown input observer (UIO) is proposed. The aim is to compute a residual signal which has minimum sensitivity to disturbances while having maximum sensitivity to faults. Robustness to unknown inputs is formulated in the sense of the<em>H<sub>∞</sub></em>-norm by means of the bounded real lemma (BRL) for LPV delayed systems. In order to formulate fault sensitivity conditions, a reference model which characterizes the ideal residual behavior in a faulty situation is considered. The residual error with respect to this reference model is computed. Then, the maximization of the residual fault effect is converted to minimization of its effect on the residual error and is addressed by using the BRL. The compromise between the unknown input effect and the fault effect on the residual is translated into a multi-objective optimization problem with some LMI constraints. In order to show the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method, a part of the Barcelona sewer system is considered.
