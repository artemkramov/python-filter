Shape optimization of labyrinth seals
Rajae Aboulaïch, Karim Azelmat, Jacques Baranger, Ali Souissp
In this work, we determine the optimal shape of a labyrinth seal in a hydraulic Francis turbine. The numerical approximation of the optimal shape is obtained using shape optimization techniques. The flow is governed by Navier-Stokes equations. We first prove the existence of an optimal domain, and later we present the computation of the shape gradient which allows us to approximate numerically the optimal domain.
