Temporal logic as a tool for program correctness analysis
Radosław Klimek
The paper deals with temporal logic and analysis of correctness properties of programs. A classification of program properties is presented. Verification by temporal logic is shown on the examples of synchronization in the producer-consumer problem and a sample parallel system of robots. The analysis of the system concerns three types of safety property.
