Normal forms of kinematic singularities of 3R robot manipulators
Krzysztof Tchoń
Using the singularity theory approach we study kinematic singularities of 3R robot manipulators satisfying certain geometric conditions. A classification of singular configurations is set forth and three mathematical models (normal forms) of the kinematics around singular configurations are derived.
