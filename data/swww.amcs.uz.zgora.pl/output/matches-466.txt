Existence of solutions of boundary value problems of differential inclusions
Michał Kisielewicz, Jerzy Motyl
We are interested in the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions of differential inclusions<em>x(t) ∈ F(t, x(t))</em>for a.e.<em>t ∈ [0, T]</em>satisfying boundary conditions<em>x(0) = x<sub>0</sub></em>and<em>x(T) = x<sub>1</sub></em>.
