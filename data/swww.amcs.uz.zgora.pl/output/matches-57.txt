An<em>n</em>-ary<em>λ</em>-averaging based similarity classifier
Onesfole Kurama, Pasi Luukka, Mikael Collan
We introduce a new<em>n</em>-ary<em>λ</em>similarity classifier that is based on a new<em>n</em>-ary<em>λ</em>-averaging operator in the aggregation of similarities. This work is a natural extension of earlier research on similarity based classification in which aggregation is commonly performed by using the OWA-operator. So far<em>λ</em>-averaging has been used only in binary aggregation. Here the<em>λ</em>-averaging operator is extended to the<em>n</em>-ary aggregation case by using t-norms and t-conorms. We examine four different<em>n</em>-ary norms and test the new similarity classifier with five medical data sets. The new method seems to perform well when compared with the similarity classifier.
