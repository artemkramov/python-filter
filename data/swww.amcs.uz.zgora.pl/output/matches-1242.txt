A functorial approach to the behaviour of multidimensional control systems
Jean-François Pommaret, Alban Quadrat
We show how to use the extension and torsion functors in order to compute the torsion submodule of a differential module associated with a multidimensional control system. In particular, we show that the concept of the weak primeness of matrices corresponds to the torsion-freeness of a certain module.
