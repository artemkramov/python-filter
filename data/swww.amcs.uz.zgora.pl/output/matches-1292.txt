Bilateral polynomial equations with unimodular right-hand-side matrices
Tadeusz Kaczorek
Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the existence of a solution to some bilateral polynomial matrix equations with unimodular right-hand-side matrices. A procedure for the computation of the solution is derived and illustrated by a numerical example. Two examples of applications of bilateral polynomial matrix equations are presented.
