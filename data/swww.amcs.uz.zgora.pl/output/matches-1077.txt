This paper develops a new actuator failure compensation scheme for two linked two-wheel drive (2WD) mobile robots based on multiple-model control. First, a configuration of two linked 2WD robots is described, and their kinematics and dynamics are modeled. Then, a multiple-model based failure compensation scheme is developed to compensate for actuator failures, consisting of a kinematic controller, multiple dynamic controllers and a control switching mechanism, which ensures system stability and asymptotic tracking properties. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed failure compensation control system.
