Towards a linguistic description of dependencies in data
Ildar Batyrshin, Michael Wagenknecht
The problem of a linguistic description of dependencies in data by a set of rules<em>R<sub>k</sub></em>: "If<em>X</em>is<em>T<sub>k</sub></em>then<em>Y</em>is<em>S<sub>k</sub></em>" is considered, where<em>T<sub>k</sub></em>'s are linguistic terms like<em>SMALL, BETWEEN 5 AND 7</em>describing some fuzzy intervals<em>A<sub>k</sub></em>.<em>S<sub>k</sub></em>'s are linguistic terms like<em>DECREASING</em>and<em>QUICKLY INCREASING</em>describing the slopes<em>p<sub>k</sub></em>of linear functions<em>y<sub>k</sub>= p<sub>k</sub>x+q<sub>k</sub></em>approximating data on<em>A<sub>k</sub></em>. The decision of this problem is obtained as a result of a fuzzy partition of the domain<em>X</em>on fuzzy intervals<em>A<sub>k</sub></em>, approximation of given data<em>{x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>}, i = 1, . . . , n</em>by linear functions<em>y<sub>k</sub>= p<sub>k</sub>x+q<sub>k</sub></em>on these intervals and by re-translation of the obtained results into linguistic form. The properties of the genetic algorithm used for construction of the optimal partition and several methods of data re-translation are described. The methods are illustrated by examples, and potential applications of the proposed methods are discussed.
