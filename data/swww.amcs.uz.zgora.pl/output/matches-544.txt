Neural networks as a tool for georadar data processing
Piotr Szymczyk, Sylwia Tomecka-Suchoń, Magdalena Szymczyk
In this article a new neural network based method for automatic classification of ground penetrating radar (GPR) traces is proposed. The presented approach is based on a new representation of GPR signals by polynomials approximation. The coefficients of the polynomial (the feature vector) are neural network inputs for automatic classification of a special kind of geologic structure—a sinkhole. The analysis and results show that the classifier can effectively distinguish sinkholes from other geologic structures.
