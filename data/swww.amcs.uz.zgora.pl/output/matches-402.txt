A fixed point method in quasistatic rate-type viscoplasticity
Seddik Djabi, Mircea Sofonea
Two initial and boundary value problems describing the quasistatic evolution of semilinear rate-type viscoplastic models with/without internal state variables are considered. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved using only classical existence and uniqueness results for linear elasticity followed by a fixed point technique.
