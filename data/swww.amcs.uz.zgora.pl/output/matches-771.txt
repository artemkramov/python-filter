Normalized finite fractional differences: Computational and accuracy breakthroughs
Rafał Stanisławski, Krzysztof J. Latawiec
This paper presents a series of new results in finite and infinite-memory modeling of discrete-time fractional differences. The introduced<em>normalized finite fractional difference</em>is shown to properly approximate its fractional difference original, in particular in terms of the steady-state properties. A stability analysis is also presented and a recursive computation algorithm is offered for finite fractional differences. A thorough analysis of computational and accuracy aspects is culminated with the introduction of a<em>perfect finite fractional difference</em>and, in particular, a powerful<em>adaptive finite fractional difference</em>, whose excellent performance is illustrated in simulation examples.
