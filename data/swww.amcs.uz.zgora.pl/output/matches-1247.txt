Controllability and reconstructability of a system described by the<em>N</em>-D Roesser model
Jerzy E. Kurek
The controllability and reconstructability (global) of the system described by a digital<em>N</em>-D Roesser model are defined. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for system controllability and reconstructability are given. The conditions constitute a generalization of the corresponding conditions for 1-D systems.
