Random projections and Hotelling’s<em>T<sup>2</sup></em>statistics for change detection in high-dimensional data streams
Ewa Skubalska-Rafajłowicz
The method of change (or anomaly) detection in high-dimensional discrete-time processes using a multivariate Hotelling chart is presented. We use normal random projections as a method of dimensionality reduction. We indicate diagnostic properties of the Hotelling control chart applied to data projected onto a random subspace of ℝ<em><sup>n</sup></em>. We examine the random projection method using artificial noisy image sequences as examples.
