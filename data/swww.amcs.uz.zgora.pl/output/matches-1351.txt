Control of an induction motor using sliding mode linearization
Erik Etien, Sébastien Cauet, Laurent Rambault, Gérard Champenois
Nonlinear control of the squirrel induction motor is designed using sliding mode theory. The developed approach leads to the design of a sliding mode controller in order to linearize the behaviour of an induction motor. The second problem described in the paper is decoupling between two physical outputs: the rotor speed and the rotor flux modulus. The sliding mode tools allow us to separate the control from these two outputs. To take account of parametric variations, a model-based approach is used to improve the robustness of the control law despite these perturbations. Experimental results obtained with a laboratory setup illustrate the good performance of this technique.
