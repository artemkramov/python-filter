Minimum energy control of fractional descriptor positive discrete-time linear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
Necessary and sufficient conditions for the positivity and reachability of fractional descriptor positive discrete-time linear systems are established. The minimum energy control problem for descriptor positive systems is formulated and solved. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the minimum energy control problem are given. A procedure for computation of optimal input sequences and a minimal value of the performance index is proposed and illustrated by a numerical example.
