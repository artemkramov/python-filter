A stabilizing control law for invariant systems on Lie groups
Nikolaos Apostolou, Demosthenes Kazakos
This paper deals with the stabilizability of invariant control systems defined on Lie groups. A stabilization technique is presented which, under certain hypotheses, can lead to a criterion assuring the existence of a feedback controller which steers every initial condition to a specified target point of the state space of these systems.
