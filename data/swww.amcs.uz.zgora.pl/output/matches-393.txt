Petri nets in ASIC design
Marian Adamski
This paper shows how Petri nets can be used for the design of a complex digital system. Many well known methods for the system description such as flowchart (ASM-charts) are not suitable for the description of parallel processes. Petri nets provide a mechanism which is well suited for representing such important phenomena in digital systems as parallelism and hierarchism.
