Non-singleton fuzzy models
Danuta Rutkowska
This paper presents an approach to design non-singleton fuzzy-logic systems. The relation between non-singleton and singleton fuzzy-logic systems is derived. Simulation results illustrate the effect of uncertainty of the input variables on the truck trajectories in the truck backer-upper control problem.
