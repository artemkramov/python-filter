Computation of realizations composed of dynamic and static parts of improper transfer matrices
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The problem of computing minimal realizations of a singular system decomposed into a standard dynamical system and a static system of a given improper transfer matrix is formulated and solved. A new notion of the minimal dynamical-static realization is introduced. It is shown that there always exists a minimal dynamical-static realization of a given improper transfer matrix. A procedure for the computation of a minimal dynamical-static realization for a given improper transfer matrix is proposed and illustrated by a numerical example.
