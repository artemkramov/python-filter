Linear adaptive structure for control of a nonlinear MIMO dynamic plant
Stanisław Bańka, Paweł Dworak, Krzysztof Jaroszewski
In the paper an adaptive linear control system structure with modal controllers for a MIMO nonlinear dynamic process is presented and various methods for synthesis of those controllers are analyzed. The problems under study are exemplified by the synthesis of a position and yaw angle control system for a drillship described by a 3DOF nonlinear mathematical model of low-frequency motions made by the drillship over the drilling point. In the proposed control system, use is made of a set of (stable) linear modal controllers that create a linear adaptive controller with variable parameters tuned appropriately to operation conditions chosen on the basis of two measured auxiliary signals. These are the ship’s current forward speed measured in reference to the water and the systematically calculated difference between the course angle and the sea current (yaw angle). The system synthesis is carried out by means of four different methods for system pole placement after having linearized the model of low-frequency motions made by the vessel at its nominal “operating points” in steady states that are dependent on the specified yaw angle and the sea current velocity. The final part of the paper includes simulation results of system operation with an adaptive controller of (stepwise) varying parameters along with conclusions and final remarks.
