Realization problem for a class of positive continuous-time systems with delays
Tadeusz Kaczorek
The realization problem for a class of positive, continuous-time linear SISO systems with one delay is formulated and solved. Sufficient conditions for the existence of positive realizations of a given proper transfer function are established. A procedure for the computation of positive minimal realizations is presented and illustrated by an example.
