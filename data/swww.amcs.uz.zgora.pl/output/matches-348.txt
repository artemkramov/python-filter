Estimation of the hidden layer size based on analysis of neural networks for handwritten digits recognition
Zbigniew Mikrut
The paper contains quantitative information about parameters generated in hidden layers of back-propagation type neural networks for handwritten digits recognition. On the basis of this information, a method of determination of the lower limit for the number of hidden layer elements for such networks is given. The method applies a suitable formula of combinatorics. The above-mentioned information is used to create an algorithm for the training set analysis aimed for more effective neural network initialization.
