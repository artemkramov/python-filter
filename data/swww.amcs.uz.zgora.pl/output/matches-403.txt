Physical interpretation of impact bend test by means of mathematical methods
Eugeniusz Ranatowski, Jan Sadowski, Ryszard Strzelecki
The paper deals with the possibility to apply mathematical methods to process dynamic impact bend test diagrams in force-time (<em>F – t</em>) layout. The paper presents both a methodology of taking off<em>F – t</em>characteristics and a computer-aided testing stand, as well as processing algorithms of diagrams in the field of mathematical filtration based on averaging random variable and oscilation in the field of time and frequency. A procedure for defining characteristic points of the sample impact cracking process has also been defined. As a complement to theoretical consideration, the paper presents an example of specific processing of<em>F – t</em>diagrams for<em>C – Mn</em>steel sample, which may be the basis for evaluation of failure process parameters in crack mechanics bearing.
