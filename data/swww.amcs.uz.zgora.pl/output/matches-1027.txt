Actuator fault tolerance in control systems with predictive constrained set-point optimizers
Piotr M. Marusak, Piotr Tatjewski
echanisms of fault tolerance to actuator faults in a control structure with a predictive constrained set-point optimizer are proposed. The structure considered consists of a basic feedback control layer and a local supervisory set-point optimizer which executes as frequently as the feedback controllers do with the aim to recalculate the set-points both for constraint feasibility and economic performance. The main goal of the presented reconfiguration mechanisms activated in response to an actuator blockade is to continue the operation of the control system with the fault, until it is fixed. This may be even long-term, if additional manipulated variables are available. The mechanisms are relatively simple and consist in the reconfiguration of the model structure and the introduction of appropriate constraints into the optimization problem of the optimizer, thus not affecting the numerical effectiveness. Simulation results of the presented control system for a multivariable plant are provided, illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach.
