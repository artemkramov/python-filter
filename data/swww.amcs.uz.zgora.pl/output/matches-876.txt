A hierarchical decomposition of decision process Petri nets for modeling complex systems
Julio Clempner
We provide a framework for hierarchical specification called Hierarchical Decision Process Petri Nets (HDPPNs). It is an extension of Decision Process Petri Nets (DPPNs) including a hierarchical decomposition process that generates less complex nets with equivalent behavior. As a result, the complexity of the analysis for a sophisticated system is drastically reduced. In the HDPPN, we represent the mark-dynamic and trajectory-dynamic properties of a DPPN. Within the framework of the mark-dynamic properties, we show that the HDPPN theoretic notions of (local and global) equilibrium and stability are those of the DPPN. As a result in the trajectory-dynamic properties framework, we obtain equivalent characterizations of that of the DPPN for final decision points and stability. We show that the HDPPN mark-dynamic and trajectory-dynamic properties of equilibrium, stability and final decision points coincide under some restrictions. We propose an algorithm for optimum hierarchical trajectory planning. The hierarchical decomposition process is presented under a formal treatment and is illustrated with application examples.
