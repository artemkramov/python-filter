Model reference adaptive control of unknown plants using dynamic neural networks
George A. Rovithakis, Manolis A. Christodoulou
A direct non-linear adaptive controller solving the tracking problem for unknown dynamic systems which are modelled by dynamic neural networks is discussed. A complete model matching case is examined and convergence of the control error to zero plus boundedness of all signals in the closed loop are ensured.
