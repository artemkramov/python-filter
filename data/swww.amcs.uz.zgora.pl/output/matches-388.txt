Real-time vision-aided traffic monitoring
E.L. Dagless, A.T. Ali
Image processing systems are becoming more suitable for surveillance and traffic monitoring. The paper reports on some techniques for monitoring traffic flow on motorways, using a moving object detector operating in small windows. Traffic monitoring is demonstrated using a relaxed coincidence search technique, and successful results are reported from video of a busy complex junction layout.
