A quasigroup-based public-key cryptosystem
Czesław Kościelny, Gary L. Mullen
A public-key cryptosystem, using generalized quasigroup-based streamciphers is presented. It is shown that such a cryptosystem allows one to transmit securely both a cryptogram and a secret portion of the enciphering key using the same insecure channel. The system is illustrated by means of a simple, but non-trivial, example.
