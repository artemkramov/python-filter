Source identification in distributed parameter systems
Mikhail Skliar, W. Fred Ramirez
In this paper, we solve the problem of the pointwise source identification of the convection-diffusion transport processes. This is done by converting the identification problem into an optimization problem of finding a spatial location and the capacity of a point source which results in the best match of model-predicted measurements to actual observed measurements.
