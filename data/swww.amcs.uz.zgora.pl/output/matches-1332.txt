An architecture for making judgments using computing with words
Jerry M. Mendel
Our thesis is that computing with words needs to account for the uncertainties associated with the meanings of words, and that these uncertainties require using type-2 fuzzy sets. Doing this leads to a proposed architecture for making<em>judgments</em>by means of computing with words, i.e., to a<em>perceptual computer</em>- the Per-C. The Per-C includes an encoder, a type-2 rulebased fuzzy logic system, and a decoder. It lets all human-computer interactions be performed using words. In this paper, a quantitative language is established for the Per-C, and many open issues about the perceptual computer are described.
