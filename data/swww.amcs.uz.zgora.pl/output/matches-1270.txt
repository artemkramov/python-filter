Mathematical modeling of the competition between acquired immunity and cancer
Mikhail Kolev
In this paper we propose and analyse a model of the competition between cancer and the acquired immune system. The model is a system of integro-differential bilinear equations. The role of the humoral response is analyzed. The simulations are related to the immunotherapy of tumors with antibodies.
