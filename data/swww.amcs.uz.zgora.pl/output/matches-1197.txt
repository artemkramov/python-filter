Asymptotic behaviour of a discrete dynamical system generated by a simple evolutionary process
Iwona Karcz-Dulęba
A simple model of phenotypic evolution is introduced and analysed in a space of population states. The expected values of the population states generate a discrete dynamical system. The asymptotic behaviour of the system is studied with the use of classical tools of dynamical systems. The number, location and stability of fixed points of the system depend on parameters of a fitness function and the parameters of the evolutionary process itself. The influence of evolutionary process parameters on the stability of the fixed points is discussed. For large values of the standard deviation of mutation, fixed points become unstable and periodical orbits arise. An analysis of the periodical orbits is presented.
