We review the realization theory of polynomial (transfer function) matrices via ''pure'' generalized state space system models. The concept of an<em>irreducible-at-infinity</em>generalized state space realization of a polynomial matrix is defined and the mechanism of the ''cancellations'' of ''decoupling zeros at infinity'' is closely examined. The difference between the concepts of<em>irreducibility</em>and<em>minimality</em>of generalized state space realizations of polynomial (transfer function) matrices is pointed out and the associated concepts of<em>dynamic</em>and<em>non-dynamic</em>variables appearing in generalized state space realizations are also examined.
