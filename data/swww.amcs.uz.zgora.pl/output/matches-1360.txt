Optimal feedback control proportional to the system state can be found for non-causal descriptor systems (A remark on a paper by P.C. Müller)
Galina A. Kurina
Optimal feedback control depending only on the system state is constructed for a control problem by the non-causal descriptor system for which optimal feedback control depending on state derivatives was considered in the paper (Müller, 1998). To this end, a non-symmetric solution of the algebraic operator Riccati equation is used.
