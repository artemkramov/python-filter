This paper proposes an<em>H<sub>−</sub>/H<sub>∞</sub></em>fault detection observer method by using generalized output for a class of polytopic linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. As the main contribution, with the aid of the relative degree of output, a new output vector is generated by gathering the original output and its time derivative, and it is feasible to consider<em>H<sub>−</sub></em>actuator fault sensitivity in the entire frequency for the new system. In order to improve actuator and sensor fault sensitivity as well as guarantee robustness against disturbances, simultaneously, an<em>H<sub>−</sub>/H<sub>∞</sub></em>fault detection observer is designed for the new LPV polytopic system. Besides, the design conditions of the proposed observer are transformed into an optimization problem by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
