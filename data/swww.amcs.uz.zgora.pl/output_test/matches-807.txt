A study on new right/left inverses of nonsquare polynomial matrices
Wojciech P. Hunek, Krzysztof J. Latawiec
This paper presents several new results on the inversion of full normal rank nonsquare polynomial matrices. New analytical right/left inverses of polynomial matrices are introduced, including the so-called<em>τ</em>-inverses,<em>σ</em>-inverses and, in particular,<em>S</em>-inverses, the latter providing the most general tool for the design of various polynomial matrix inverses. The application-oriented problem of selecting stable inverses is also solved. Applications in inverse-model control, in particular robust minimum variance control, are exploited, and possible applications in signal transmission/recovery in various types of MIMO channels are indicated.
