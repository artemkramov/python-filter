Positive 2D discrete-time linear Lyapunov systems
Przemys≈Çaw Przyborowski, Tadeusz Kaczorek
Two models of positive 2D discrete-time linear Lyapunov systems are introduced. For both the models necessary and sufficient conditions for positivity, asymptotic stability, reachability and observability are established. The discussion is illustrated with numerical examples.
