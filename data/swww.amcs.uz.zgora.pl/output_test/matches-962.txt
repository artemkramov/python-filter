On path following control of nonholonomic mobile manipulators
Alicja Mazur, Dawid Szakiel
This paper describes the problem of designing control laws for path following robots, including two types of nonholonomic mobile manipulators. Due to a cascade structure of the motion equation, a backstepping procedure is used to achieve motion along a desired path. The control algorithm consists of two simultaneously working controllers: the kinematic controller, solving motion constraints, and the dynamic controller, preserving an appropriate coordination between both subsystems of a mobile manipulator, i.e. the mobile platform and the manipulating arm. A description of the nonholonomic subsystem relative to the desired path using the Frenet parametrization is the basis for formulating the path following problem and designing a kinematic control algorithm. In turn, the dynamic control algorithm is a modification of a passivity-based controller. Theoretical deliberations are illustrated with simulations.
