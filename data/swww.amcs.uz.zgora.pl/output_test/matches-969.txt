Recursive identification algorithm for dynamic systems with output backlash and its convergence
Ruili Dong, Qingyuan Tan, Yonghong Tan
This paper proposes a recursive identification method for systems with output backlash that can be described by a pseudo- Wiener model. In this method, a novel description of the nonlinear part of the system, i.e., backlash, is developed. In this case, the nonlinear system is decomposed into a piecewise linearized model. Then, a modified recursive general identification algorithm (MRGIA) is employed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Furthermore, the convergence of the MRGIA for the pseudo-Wiener system with backlash is analysed. Finally, a numerical example is presented.
