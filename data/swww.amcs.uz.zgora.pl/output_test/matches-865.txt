On one algorithm for solving the problem of source function reconstruction
Vyacheslav Maksimov
In the paper, the problem of source function reconstruction in a differential equation of the parabolic type is investigated. Using the semigroup representation of trajectories of dynamical systems, we build a finite-step iterative procedure for solving this problem. The algorithm originates from the theory of closed-loop control (the method of extremal shift). At every step of the algorithm, the sum of a quality criterion and a linear penalty term is minimized. This procedure is robust to perturbations in problems data.
