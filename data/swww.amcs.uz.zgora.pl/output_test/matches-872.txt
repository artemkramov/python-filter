A vehicle-track-soil dynamic interaction problem in sequential and parallel formulation
Janusz Kogut, Henryk Ciurej
Some problems regarding numerical modeling of predicted vibrations excited by railway traffic are discussed. Model formulation in the field of structural mechanics comprises a vehicle, a track (often in a tunnel) and soil. Time consuming computations are needed to update large matrices at every discrete step. At first, a sequential Matlab code is generated. Later on, the formulation is modified to use grid computing, thereby a significant reduction in computational time is expected.
