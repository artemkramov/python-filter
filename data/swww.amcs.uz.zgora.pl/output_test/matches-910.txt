Reduction in the number of LUT elements for control units with code sharing
Alexander Barkalov, Larysa Titarenko, Jacek Bieganowski
Two methods are proposed targeted at reduction in the number of look-up table elements in logic circuits of compositional microprogram control units (CMCUs) with code sharing. The methods assume the application of field-programmable gate arrays for the implementation of the combinational part of the CMCU, whereas embedded-memory blocks are used for implementation of its control memory. Both methods are based on the existence of classes of pseudoequivalent operational linear chains in a microprogram to be implemented. Conditions for the application of the proposed methods and examples of design are shown. Results of conducted experiments are given.
