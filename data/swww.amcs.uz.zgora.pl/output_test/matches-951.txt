Reliable robust path planning with application to mobile robots
Romain Pepy, Michel Kieffer, Eric Walter
This paper is devoted to path planning when the safety of the system considered has to be guaranteed in the presence of bounded uncertainty affecting its model. A new path planner addresses this problem by combining Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and a set representation of uncertain states. An idealized algorithm is presented first, before a description of one of its possible implementations, where compact sets are wrapped into boxes. The resulting path planner is then used for nonholonomic path planning in robotics.
