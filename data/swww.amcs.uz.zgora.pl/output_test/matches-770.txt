A modified state variable diagram method for determination of positive realizations of linear continuous-time systems with delays
Tadeusz Kaczorek
A new modified state variable diagram method is proposed for determination of positive realizations of linear continuous-time systems with delays in state and input vectors. Using the method, it is possible to find a positive realization with reduced numbers of delays for a given transfer matrix. Sufficient conditions for the existence of positive realizations of given proper transfer matrices are established. The proposed method is demonstrated on numerical examples.
