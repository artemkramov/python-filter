Effective dual-mode fuzzy DMC algorithms with on-line quadratic optimization and guaranteed stability
Piotr M. Marusak, Piotr Tatjewski
Dual-mode fuzzy dynamic matrix control (fuzzy DMC-FDMC) algorithms with guaranteed nominal stability for constrained nonlinear plants are presented. The algorithms join the advantages of fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno modeling and the predictive dual-mode approach in a computationally efficient version. Thus, they can bring an improvement in control quality compared with predictive controllers based on linear models and, at the same time, control performance similar to that obtained using more demanding algorithms with nonlinear optimization. Numerical effectiveness is obtained by using a successive linearization approach resulting in a quadratic programming problem solved on-line at each sampling instant. It is a computationally robust and fast optimization problem, which is important for on-line applications. Stability is achieved by appropriate introduction of dual-mode type stabilization mechanisms, which are simple and easy to implement. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a control system of a nonlinear plant—a distillation column with basic feedback controllers.
