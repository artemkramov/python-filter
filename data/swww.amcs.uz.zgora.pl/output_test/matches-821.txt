Regional control problem for distributed bilinear systems: Approach and simulations
Karima Ztot, El Hassan Zerrik, Hamid Bourray
This paper investigates the regional control problem for infinite dimensional bilinear systems. We develop an approach that characterizes the optimal control and leads to a numerical algorithm. The obtained results are successfully illustrated by simulations.
