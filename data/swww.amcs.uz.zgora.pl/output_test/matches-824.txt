New stability conditions for positive continuous-discrete 2D linear systems
Tadeusz Kaczorek
New necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of positive continuous-discrete 2D linear systems are established. Necessary conditions for the stability are also given. The stability tests are demonstrated on numerical examples.
