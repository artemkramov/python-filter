Parallel implementation of local thresholding in Mitrion-C
Tomasz Kryjak, Marek Gorgo≈Ñ
Mitrion-C based implementations of three image processing algorithms: a look-up table operation, simple local thresholding and Sauvola's local thresholding are described. Implementation results, performance of the design and FPGA logic utilization are discussed.
