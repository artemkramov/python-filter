The plant is cultivated under the agro climate soil conditions and the field of biotechnology as most of the pharmaceutical industries depends Largely on the utilization of plants for the production of compounds to study the variability in natural infection rates, spore density and species richness of AM fungi associated with and medicinal plant Solanum viarum which was culture from herbal garden at poondi, Thanjavur. The efficient of AM fungi and their mass production of Sorghum bicolor roots by pot culturing techniques were assessed.
