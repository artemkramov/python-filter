Thermodestruction of wastes generated by the thermal processing of household wastes: Thermal study of the equipment in turbulent regime
In this work, we conduct a thermal study on the installation of an incinerator of gas generated by the carbonization of household wastes. We used forced and turbulent flows, with Reynolds number ranging between 5,000 and 20,000. This combustion phenomenon is handled with Navier-Stokes equations, those on the energy and distribution of the species contained in smokes to which we associate k-ε closure model. To handle this combustion phenomenon, we use the FLUENT code that directly integrates all the equations on turbulence, k-ε model for the equating and discrete ordinates model for radiative transfers. Temperatures, around 600 K for a Reynolds number of 5,000, decrease when Reynolds number increases. Results show that highest temperatures are found near the walls of the incinerator. Given the quantity of energy released in these areas, thermal recovery is possible, but this must be properly done to minimize losses.
