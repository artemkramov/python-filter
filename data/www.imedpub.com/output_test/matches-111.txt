Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce is a deep rooted, nitrogen fixing, multipurpose tree endemic to the hot deserts of India. The tree is known locally as Jandi or Khejri (India), Jand (Pakistan), and Ghaf (Arabic). Its synonym is P. spicigera. These trees are the essential component of the agroforestry land use system in these parts of India. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and subfamily Mimosoideae. In this paper we examined bees for pollination biology of Prosopis cineraria flowering at the end of during dry season. The flowers are small, massed into globose heads and function as units of reproduction. The plant is self-incompatible and exhibits synchronous flowering to facilitate cross-pollination. Prosopis cineraria produces small quantities of concentrated nectar, and has abundant pollen resources available to bee pollinators. We recorded some numbers of bee visitors and most fruit set on the tops of trees. Also in wasps and flies were the most numerous visitors and are likely to play a significant role in pollination.The dry season in arid region, Rajasthan State, India
