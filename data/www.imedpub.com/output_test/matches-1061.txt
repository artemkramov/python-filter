Serpentinized Peridotites of BiÃ¢ÂÂr Tuluhah Ophiolite Complex, Saudi Arabia- Some geological aspects and Economic perspective
This paper presents an account of various observations encompassing field geological, petrographic, genetic aspects and economic significance of serpentinized peridotites of ophiolite complex of Bi’r Tuluhah area of Saudi Arabia. The Bi’r Tuluhah ophiolites were emplaced during sinistral transpression of the Hulayfah-Ad Dafinah- Ruwah suture. The complex comprises a suite of layered gabbro, diorite, serpentinized peridotite and amphibolite. The ophiolites are strongly deformed, metamorphosed, and altered by listwaenitization (silicification and carbonatization) in the shear zones with predominantly low-grade greenschist facies metamorphism and in some places amphibolite grade. Petrography of serpentinized peridotite revealed enriched serpentinization and calcitization. Field evidences and laboratory studies indicate that the area may have a good potential for gold, chromium and allied mineralization.
