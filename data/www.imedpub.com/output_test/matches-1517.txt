Diversity of Invertebrate trawl by catch off Mallipattinam, Sathubavasatherum, Memesal, southeast coast of India
Invertebrate by-catch diversity was studied in the inshore waters of (5- 35m depth) of Mallipattinam, Sathubavasamuthrum and Memesal during Feb 2010 – Jan 2011. In the present study, brachyuran crabs, shrimps, stomatopods, cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves, echinoderms and jellyfish were recorded. Altogether 67 species of invertebrates in Mallipattinam, Sathubavasathrum and 76 in Memesal were recorded during the study period. The percentage compositions of invertebrates were calculated. Diversity indices calculated showed variation of the different station. Shannon-Weiner diversity index ranged from 2.035 to 4.776; Margalef’s richness index was ranged from 2.306 to 6.782; Pielou’s evenness index varied from 0.488 to 0; taxonomic diversity varied from 0.488 to 0.957 and total phylogenetic diversity ranged from 733.33 to 1716.8, indicated different level of ecological state of the different station and different months.
