On Some Length-Biased Weighted Weibull Distribution
In this paper, we develop the length-biased form of the weighted Weibull distribution (WWD) named as length-biased weighted Weibull distribution (LBWWD). Well known distributions are generated by expanding suitable function of the parameters. Shape of the distribution is studied in detail. Various properties of length-biased WWD are discussed. Newby’s method along with method of moment has been used to estimate the parameters of the length-biased WWD. To justify the use of LBWWD; LBWWD is fitted to 30 consecutive year’s data from 1981 - 2010 of June rainfall (in mm) of Tezpur, Assam, India.
