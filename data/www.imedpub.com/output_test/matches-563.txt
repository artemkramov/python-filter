Contamination by Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and Dibenzop- furans (PCDFs) in Selected Solid Wastes: An Implication of Potential Sources of Pollution
In this study seventeen congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-furans (PCDDs/Fs) in selected solid wastes analyzed by HRGC-HRMS applying the isotopic dilution technique. Recovery rates of spiked 13C12-labeled standard compounds were calculated and found within the accepted ranges for all the samples. The observed concentration of 17 PCDDs/Fs was 13763.00 pg g-1, 256.66 pg g-1, 1857.63 pg g-1 and 9.64 pg g-1 dw, in sewage sludge, paper mill sludge, industrial contaminated soil and flyash, respectively. The 2,3,7,8- TeCDD substituted toxic equivalent (I-TEQ) was 77.068 pg I-TEQ g-1, 11.319 pg I-TEQ g-1, 96.316 pg I-TEQ g-1 and 0.401 pg I-TEQ g-1, respectively. OCDD, Hep-CDD, OCDF, Hep-CDF and TCDF were the dominant congeners. In this study, the ratio of ΣPCDD/ΣPCDF was 10.39, 4.91, 4.28 and 3.97 for sewage sludge, paper mill sludge, soil and flyash, respectively which indicates that PCDD/Fs sources in the studied samples were contaminated significantly with the mechanism of the precursor formation routes. The concentration levels observed in this study were lower than recommended guideline values
