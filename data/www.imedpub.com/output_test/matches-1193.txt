Optimization of growth condition for diesel oil degrading bacterial strains
Three efficient diesel oil degrading bacterial strains were isolated from soil sample collected at diesel contaminated sites in Dindigul,Tamilnadu and were identified as Pseudomonas sp, Bacillus sp and Micrococcus sp. The results of the study reveals that the better degradation of diesel oil was recorded in Pseudomonas sp ans Bacillus sp with 1% diesel oil at 37 0C on 7th day. The higher percentage of microbial biomass was recorded in Bushnell-Haas medium supplemented with sunflower oil as carbon source and ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source. Among the three bacterial isolates Pseudomonas sp was identified as efficient diesel oil degrader
