Characterization of nanocrystalline CdS thin films deposited on FTO by CBD for photosensor applications
Nanocrystalline cadmium sulphide (CdS) thin films were deposited on FTO coated glass substrate by simple and low cost chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique, and the structural, optical and photosensing properties were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique has been used to identify the phases present in the deposited films and XRD studies confirmed the nanocrystalline mixed (hexagonal and cubic) CdS phase formation. The lattice parameters are calculated as a = 4.157 Å and c = 6.58 Å, which are in good agreement with the standard data. The surface morphology of the deposited films has been characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and observed that homogeneous and uniform CdS film is grown onto FTO coated glass substrate. The optical bandgap of the films has been studied using absorption spectra in wavelength range 400-900 nm by using double beam spectrophotometer and is estimated to be 2.15 eV. The I-V characteristics showed good photoresponse, and CdS thin films deposited on FTO coated glass substrate is useful for photosensor applications
