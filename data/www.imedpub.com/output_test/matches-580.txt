Evaluation of synergistic effect of Chlorophytum borivilianum extract on transdermal delivery of Pramipexole with its mechanism of action.
Saponin rich fraction of Chlorophytum borivilianum was investigated for transdermal enhancer activity by using human cadaver skin in vitro with pramipexol as the model drug. Moreover, FT-IR studies were conducted to understand to possible enhancement mechanism. Results shows significantly increased flux of the drug compared to control (p&lt;0.05). Similarly permeability coefficient (Kp), cumulative amount release (Q24) and enhancement ratio (ER) shown significant increase over control sample. FT-IR studies reveal that Chlorophytum borivilianum reduces peak area by 89.00 % for symmetric and asymmetric stretching peaks. In addition significantly reduces percentage of secondary structures of keratin at amide I band. These results indicate that C. borivilianum enhances transdermal permeation of pramipexol by biphasic mechanism involving partial extraction of stratum corneum (SC) lipid and interaction with SC keratin.
