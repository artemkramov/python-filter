In vitro plant regeneration from apical buds of Albizzia odoratissima (L.f.) Benth
A study was initiated to explore the possibility for in vitro propagation of the economically important leguminous tree, Albizzia odoratissima due to the lack of a proper conventional method of propagation. The apical buds from 7-days-old in vitro seedlings of A. odoratissima were evaluated for direct shoot regeneration on Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) basal medium fortified with BAP (6–benzylaminopurine) and kinetin singly or in combinations of both at different concentrations. The highest percentage of response was obtained on MS media supplemented with 0.75 mg/l BAP in which 91.67% of the explants responded producing an average of 10 shoots per explants and shoot length of 4.86 ± 0.22 cms. Kinetin was found to be incapable of multiple shoot proliferation whether incorporated alone or in combination with BAP. In vitro rooting of the microshoots was induced in growth regulator-free as well as indole- 3-acetic acid (IAA) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) supplemented half strength MS medium. The best rooting response (53.33%) was observed in growth regulator-free MS medium. The highest response for acclimatization and pot establishment of the rooted plantlets was obtained in soilrite (40%).
