Metal cation exchanged cellulose as new layer material for identification and separation of organic dyes
Cellulose, an organic material has been used in the form of thin layer after treating with aqueous salt solutions of metal cations to utilize its chromatographic performance for identification of organic dyes with preliminary separation by thin layer chromatographic technique. The newly developed metal cation exchanged cellulose in combination of surfactants-mediated mobile phase systems has proved novel stationary phase for achieving important separations of organic dyes by thin layer chromatography. Several important separations of organic dyes achieved using proposed thin layer chromatographic systems have been listed. It is the first report on the use of metal cation exchanged cellulose as stationary phase in combination of surfactants-mediated mobile phase systems for identification and selective separation of organic dyes including food dyes
