Kinetics and mechanism of quinaldine with methylene blue as photo sensitizer
The photosensitized reaction of Quinaldine (2-methyl-8-hydroxyquinoline) has been studied in the alkaline medium in the visible light using Methylene blue (MB) as photo sensitizer. The rate of the reaction has been calculated. The effect of the parameters like pH, concentration of the sensitizer, concentration of the substrate, and intensity of the light on the rate of the photosensitized reaction has been studied. The reaction has been studied in anaerobic condition to observe the effect of the oxygen. Methanol shows free radical scavenging effect. The quantum efficiency of the photosensitized reaction has been calculated. The scheme of the reaction mechanism is suggested. The singlet state of the oxygen (1O2) participates in the photoreaction and photo oxidation products are formed by oxidation of the substrates. The reaction has been studied using U.V.-visible spectroscopy and product analyzed with Mass- Spectrometry
