Study of blood flow through a catheterized artery
The problem of blood flow through a symmetric stenosis during artery catheterization assuming blood to behave like a Newtonian fluid is discussed in the present analysis. The analytical expressions for the blood flow characteristics, namely, the impedance, the wall shear stress in the stenotic region and the shear stress at stenosis throat are derived. The impedance increases with the increasing size of the catheter and assumes considerable higher magnitude in a catheterized artery than its corresponding magnitude in uncatheterized for any given set of parameters fixed. Also, for any given catheter size the impedance increases with the stenosis size (height and length). The wall shear stress distribution in the stenotic region possesses almost an opposite characteristics in catheterized artery in comparison to its variations in an uncatheterized artery. The variations in the magnitude of the shear stress at stenosis throat are observed having opposite characteristics in comparison to the variations in the magnitude of impedance (flow resistance).
