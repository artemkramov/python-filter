Flood hazard vulnerability mapping using remote sensing &amp; GIS:A case study along the villages of Anand taluka
Flood is a natural disaster almost occurs in every part of the world. India has longest rivers passing from high population density area. During monsoon season, cyclone flood are usually happen in India. Many conditions can result in a flood: hurricanes, overtopped levees, outdated or clogged drainage systems and rapid accumulation of rainfall. Mahi is one of the longest river passing from Gujarat. This river crosses three states Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat &amp; Rajasthan .Originating from Madhya Pradesh &amp; meets at Gulf of Khambhat. Anand district is one of the regions from which Mahi river is passing. In this paper we are selecting Anand taluka as study area .Villages near to Mahi river are highly vulnerable for flooding during monsoon season. In this paper using remote sensing &amp; GIS we are preparing base maps for villages highly vulnerable for flood. Considering parameters like Population density, Resources available and elevation of geographical area is divided in High risk zone, Moderate risk zone, and low risk zone villages.
