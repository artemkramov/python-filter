Diversity of isozyme electrophoretic patterns in Salvadora oleoides
Enzyme electrophoresis can directly reveal genetic polymorphism through demonstrating the multiple forms of a specific enzyme. Isozymic electrophoretic patterns of seven enzymes –Esterase (EST), Acid phosphatase (ACPH), Catalase (CAT), Peroxidase (PRX), Malate dehydrogenase (MDH), Phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), and Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) were analyzed in Salvadora oleoides by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Data from the migration of the staining zones indicated that five loci control EST, PRX, MDH, while two loci control CAT, PGI, PGM and ACPH is controlled by one locus. These seven enzymes led to resolution of 22 genetic loci. Of these 22 genetic loci, 18 loci were polymorphic, while 4 loci showed monomorphism. Besides showing the loci, isozymic banding pattern of heterozygous genotypes also revealed subunit structure of the enzyme (occurrence of a hybrid band indicated dimeric structure while absence of hybrid band revealed monomeric enzyme).
