Investigation of the inhibition of copper corrosion in nitric acid solutions by organic sulphide compound
The inhibition effect of the addition of organic compounds containing a sulphur group such as Diethyl sulphide (DES) on the corrosion of copper in nitric acid was studied by weight loss and polarization techniques, results obtained revealed that the organic compound is good inhibitor. Polarization studies showed that the compound is mixed type inhibitor. The adsorption of the inhibitor on the copper surface was given by Temkin’s adsorption isotherm. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of copper in nitric acid in presence of definite concentration of the inhibitor was studied in the temperature range 30-600c. The SEM examination of the copper surface revealed that the compound prevented from corrosion by adsorption on its surfaces.
