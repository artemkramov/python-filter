Delineation of stratigraphic sequence of adez off-shore field for adequate oil yield from 3-d seismic and well log data in Niger Delta, Nigeria
Adequate knowledge of the structural presentation of an offshore field is a veritable tool for the determination of the yield and viability of the oil wells. To achieve this maximally several studies need to be done before drilling wells in a field but current studies hold that the most scientific approaches include the integration of seismic analyses and well log data. Hence, 3-D seismic and gamma ray logs were employed in the delineation of the stratigraphic sequence of Adez off shore field in the lower Niger Delta region. The 3-D Seismic sections in this study delineated eight faults from which four horizons were mapped out while the stratigraphic sequence analyses of the well logs established a chrono-stratgraphic framework of the study area. The reflection seismic sequence varies laterally and are characterized by low-medium to high amplitude discontinuities indicating lateral facies changes typical of sandshale inter-beddings deposited in the environment giving insight into the basinal stratification and energy regimes that prevailed during early sedimentation. These results in the Adez field are indicative of high petroleum yield.
