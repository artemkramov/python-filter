Effect of pre and post-emergence herbicides on weed dynamics, growth and yield of soybean (Glycine Max L.)
A field experiment was conducted in zonal agricultural research station, University of agricultural sciences, (UAS) GKVK Bengaluru during Kharif, 2012 to study the effect of pre and post-emergence herbicide on weed, growth and yield of soybean (Glycine max L.). The experiment was carried out in randomized completely block design (RCBD) wherein there was combination of pre and post-emergence herbicides (pendimethalin 30 EC, metribuzin 70 WP and fenoxaprop–p-ethyl 9 EC, Imazethapyr 10 SC, respectively), farmer’s practice of intercultivation fb two hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS as well as unweeded check, all replicated thrice. The results showed that intercultivation fb.hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS recorded significantly higher grain and haulm yield (2570- 2964 kg ha-1, respectively), lower weed population and their dry weight (8.00 number and 1.00 g 0.25 m-2, respectively), no.of pods per plant (165), pod weight per plant (77g plant-1), no.of grains per pod (2.79) and hundred grains weight (19.18 g). However, pre-emergence application of metribuzin 70 WP fb. imazethapyr 10 SC and metribuzin 70 WP fb.intercultivation at 30 DAS gave lower weed population, dry weight and higher grain, haulm yield, no.of pods per plant, pod weight per plant, no.of grains per pod and 100 grains weight as compared to other herbicide treatments and unweeded check.
