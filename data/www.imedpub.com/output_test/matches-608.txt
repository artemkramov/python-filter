HCl doped PVA/ PAni Blends: DC conductivity studies
PVA/PAni blends of various compositions starting with 90/10 was prepared and was doped with HCl. The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed the two characteristic peaks at 330nm and 560nm in addition to a higher wavelength shoulder showing strong protonation. The DC conductivity measurements from room temperature to 110o C using two-probe technique showed decrease in resistivity by an order of magnitude in the case of doped sample as compared to their undoped samples.
