Thin films of Ag-Te compound of varying thicknesses at fixed composition have been formed on glass substrates in a vacuum of the order of 10-5 torr. The films were annealed at constant temperature for 6 to 8 h and then thermoelectric power (α) of annealed films has been evaluated. The thermoelectric power shows composition dependent p-type and n-type behavior. The measurements were carried out with constant temperature difference of 2 K and 10 K employing three temperature methods for low and high temperature regions respectively. Thermoelectric power (α) for both p-type and n-type materials increase with film thickness.
