A study in thermal properties of graft copolymers of cellulose and methacrylates
Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) initiated grafting of methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto cellulose extracted from pine needles along their binary monomer mixtures with acrylamide (AAm), acrylic acid (AAc) and acrylonitrile (AN) have been reported earlier. Graft copolymers have been possess imporved thermal stability as compared to cellulose as has been observed from initial decomposition temperature (IDT) of the graft copolymers. In case of Cell-g-poly(MMA) highest IDT is observed at 241.0 as compare to 232.0, the IDT of cellulose. In case of graft copolymers cell-g-poly(GMA-co-AN) highest IDT is recorded at 283.2oC and in DTA curve single exothermic peak is observed at 520.9oC. Thermal degradation behaviour of cellulosics is very important and evaluation of flammability and char formation on impregnation of additives and grafting offers scope for developing new cellulosics for various end uses.
