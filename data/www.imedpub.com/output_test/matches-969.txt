Characterization of rotatory thermohaline instability in porous medium: Darcy Brinkman Model
The present paper prescribes upper bounds for oscillatory motions of neutral or growing amplitude in rotatory thermohaline configurations of Veronis and Stern types in porous medium(Darcy-Brinkman model) in such a way that also result in sufficient conditions of stability for an initially bottom-heavy as well as initially top-heavy configuration
