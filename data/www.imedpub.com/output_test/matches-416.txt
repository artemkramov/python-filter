Effect of Triton X-100 on Degradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Pseudomonas sp. PSS6 Isolated from Municipal Wastes Sediment
This study determined the effect of surfactant Triton X-100 (1%) on biodegradation of various by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by Pseudomonas sp. PSS6. Sprayed-plate experiments were performed to find the degrading capability of the test isolate. The test strain efficiently degraded PAHs to a greater extent compared to other isolates forming an intensive clear zone in Bushnell–Haas agar. The degradation of PAHs was studied by inoculating the test isolate in mineral medium containing PAH with 1% Triton X-100.The growth of Pseudomonas sp. PSS6 and degradation of PAHs (naphthalene, fluoranthene, phenanthrene and anthracene) was influenced by 1% Triton X-100 in the mineral medium.
