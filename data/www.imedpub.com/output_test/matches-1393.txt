Measurement of Radon-222 concentration levels in water samples in Sudan
In the present research, the number of water samples is 248, collected from various places and locations in the Sudan. Then radon concentration values have been measured using passive integrated solid-state nuclear track devices containing allyl diglycol carbonate plastic detectors. Results show that the minimum average value of radon concentration found in the main channel water samples to be (6.93±1.68)Bq/L, while the maximum average value measured in Sagia (2) water samples to be (22.74±4.89) Bq/L. From our study, we found that there are no any remarkable variations seen in radon concentration for water samples taken from Hafeirs and Rivers. The overall average radon concentration for all water samples is found to be (14.24 ± 3.62) Bq/L. These values are lower than the maximum allowable concentration in water as recommended by US Environmental Protection Agency EPA
