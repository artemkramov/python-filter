Optimization and improvement of ethanol production by the incorporation of organic wastes
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the cheapest strain available for the conversion of biomass substrate. In the present study, it is used for bio-ethanol production from sugar molasses. Diluted cane molasses having total sugar and residual sugar content 7.0 and 7.14 % respectively was subjected to ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Incorporation of dried cauliflower waste and cabbage waste in molasses increased ethanol production at the level of 52.6% compared to molasses by nearly 40.8% alone. Addition of 20% yeast extract improved ethanol production upto 82% as compared to molasses alone. Cell biomass, ethanol production, final ethanol concentration and fermentation at 20% inoculum on 5 days respectively were found to be best at 10% Cabbage and cauliflower waste. The optimal value of the temperature, pH, yeast inoculum and fermentation period are found to be 350C, 5, 20% and 5 days respectively.
