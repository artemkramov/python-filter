Seed borne mycoflora of mung bean (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) and its control by fungicides
Seeds of Mung bean cv. P.M. 4 were examined for seed borne mycoflora by Agar plate method and Blotter method. Fourteen fungal species by Agar plate method and nineteen fungal species by blotter method have been isolated. The most common fungi were Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizopus stolonifer, Rhizopus cohnii, Macrophomina phaseolina, Alternaria alternata are dominating fungi. Blotter method proved to be better than Agar plate method. The effect of three common fungicides i.e. Bavistin (carbendazim), Dithane M-45 (mancozeb), Thiram at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3% were investigated on the seed borne mycoflora and germination of Mung bean seeds. All the fungicides were effective but Bavistin proved to be most effective in reducing the seed borne mycoflora and enhancing the germination percentage
