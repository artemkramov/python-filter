Surface deformation of BaSrTiO3 by DEHI technique
We have employed ceramic method to prepare BaSrTiO3 samples. Structural, surface morphological studies have been carried out using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Off-axis Double exposure holographic interferometry (DEHI) technique has been used to study the surface deformation of BaSrTiO3 at different temperatures
