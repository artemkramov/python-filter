Nano Technology Applications, veritable Tools to the Mitigation of Global Climate Change
In the Recent times, global climate change has posed a great danger to humanity. It is any identifiable change in the worldwide climate that has occurred over decades or more. In this modern time, researchers have identified Green House Gases as the cause of global climate change. Green House Gases are from natural and anthropogenic sources. The industrial revolution of 20th century to a very large extent has contributed to the warming trend. Climate model projections indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C for their lowest emissions scenario using stringent mitigation and 2.6 to 4.8 °C for their highest. Reducing Green House Gas emission requires us to change the way we generate electricity, heat our homes and our means of transportation. These changes include generation of green energy through renewable energy sources, using green nano technologies, less carbon intensive fuels/more energy efficiency and carbon capture/ sequestration
