Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study of ancient brick samples from Salavankuppam Region, Tamilnadu, India
Infrared spectroscopy can be a very useful technique for analysis of ceramic materials. It allows in assessing basic molecular and mineralogical composition as well as the firing temperature of the ceramics. In this paper, FT-IR spectra of recently excavated archaeological bricks from salavankuppam, Tamilnadu, India were studied with as received state to establish the type of clay minerals associated with the bricks, their origin and the art of firing adopted during manufacturing. From the tentative infrared vibrational assignments with relative intensity the mineralogical composition of the ancient bricks were evaluated and by studying the differences in mineral composition in the representative samples the firing temperature and conditions were interpreted. The results showed that all the samples have been fired above 6000C.
