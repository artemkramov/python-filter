Simultaneous dyeing and anti-bacterial finishing of textile by sol-gel technique
Using the sol–gel process, functional silica coatings can be deposited on textile materials and can lead to new textile properties and applications. In the present study combined dyeing and antibacterial finish was applied on same fabrics. Cotton and polyester/cotton blend were dyed with cheap basic dyes using sol-gel method by adding glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane as cross-linking agent. Cetyltriammonium bromide was incorporated to give antibacterial textiles in these coatings. A large reduction in the bacterial count of StaphylococcusAureus was observed.Thus simultaneous dyeing with cheap basic dyes and anti-bacterial finishing is possible by this technique. In addition to antibacterial textiles we also get softening of fabric. However the technique adversely affects the mechanical properties of the fabric.
