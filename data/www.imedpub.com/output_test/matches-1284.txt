Evaluation of antibacterial and antioxidant activities of seaweeds from Pondicherry coast
Seaweeds with their diverse bioactive compounds have opened up potential opportunities in pharmaceutical and agri-food processing industries. The present study designated to evaluate antibacterial and antioxidant potential of eight seaweeds (Enteromorpha compressa, Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva fasciata, Ulva lactuca, Chaetomorpha antennina, Padina gymnospora, Grateloupia lithophila, and Hypnea valentiae) from Pondicherry coast. Brown seaweed P. gymnospora showed maximum zone of inhibition against all the five pathogens examined with maximum activity against K. pneumonia (14.7±0.5 mm). In this study, antioxidant activities were tested using five different assays, total phenolic content, total antioxidant activity, reducing power, Hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging assay, DPPH radical scavenging activity and maximum activity was observed in P. gymnospora.
