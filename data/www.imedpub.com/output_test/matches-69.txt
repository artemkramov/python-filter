Environmental effects of volatile organic compounds on ozone layer
Effect of Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and other hazardous volatile organic materials on the ozone layer by studying the advantages and disadvantages of this material upon the production of ozone by NOx gases. The rate of reaction, selectivity and optimum concentration of VOCs which can be used to protect the ozone layer and maximize the accumulation of ozone in the stratosphere using several numerical method. It is found that the rate of accumulation can be controlled by concentration VOCs materials in stratosphere layer
