A Comparative Study of Carbon Nano Materials Synthesized from Karanja- Oil, Using Metal and Mixed Metal Catalysts
Karanja oil, on pyrolysis using different catalysts at different temperatures in inert atmosphere produces different types of Carbon Nano Materials (CNM). The Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique was used for synthesis of carbon nano materials through pyrolysis. In the present work two nano metal catalysts i.e. Nickel (Ni) and Zinc (Zn) (Copper) were used. The morphology of CNMs was examined by scanning electron-microscopy, Raman spectra and XRD analysis. The CNM morphology was affected by the catalysts and other parameters of CVD process. In presence of Ni as catalyst, formation of clusters of carbon nano beads (CNB) occurred whereas carbon nano tubes (CNTs) were produced when Zn was used as a catalyst. Most of the CNTs grew according to base growth mechanism. XRD pattern of CNB synthesized using Ni and Zn as catalyst suggested that the CNMs formed were mostly graphitic and almost negligible amorphous carbon was also present. Raman spectrum of both CNT &amp; CNBs synthesized using Ni and Zn as catalyst also confirms its graphitic nature. However when mixed metal alloy were used the Ni + Zn alloy showed tubular carbon in which alloy was entrapped, where as Ni + Cu alloy showed coiled tubular carbon. XRD of these carbons showed. Maximum yield of CNM was obtained when Ni was used as catalyst.
