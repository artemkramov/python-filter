Thermal and Electrical behaviour of 100 keV N+ and Ar+ ion implanted Poly( methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer
Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples were implanted with 100 keV N+ and Ar+ ions at fluence upto 2x1016 ions/cm2. Ion implantation induced modifications have been observed in the thermal as well as electrical behaviour of PMMA. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals an increase in the thermal stability and hence an increasing trend in the values of thermal degradation energy as a consequence of ion implantation for both the ions has been obtained. Electrical conductivity behaviour shows an increase in the values of conductivity in the implanted samples of PMMA. Structural rearrangements as revealed through FTIR spectroscopy were found to be in strong association with the observed changes in thermal and electrical behaviour of PMMA.
