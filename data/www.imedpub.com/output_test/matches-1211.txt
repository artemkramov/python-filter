Growth and characterization of strontium tartrate crystals in silica gel
Single Crystals of strontium tartrate were grown by a gel technique using single diffusion method. The effect of various parameters like pH of gel, gel density, gel aging, and concentrations of reactants etc. on the growth of these crystals was studied. Whitish, pale yellow, transparent, semitransparent, diamond shaped, some are needle shaped crystals of strontium tartrate were obtained. Maximum size 4 mm × 5mm, thickness 3mm crystals were obtained. The grown crystals were characterized by X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results of these observations are described and discussed
