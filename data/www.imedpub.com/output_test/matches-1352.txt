Heat source/sink effects of heat and mass transfer of magnetonanofluids over a nonlinear stretching sheet
This study investigates theoretically the problem of free convection boundary layer flow of nanofluids over a nonlinear stretching sheet in the presence of MHD and heat source/sink. The governing partial differential equations are transformed to a system of ordinary differential equations and solved numerically using fourth order Runge- Kutta method along with shooting technique. The effects of the magnetic parameter, the Prandtl number, Lewis number, power law velocity parameter, the Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, heat source/sink parameter on the fluid properties as well as on the heat and mass transfer coefficients are determined and shown graphically
