The length-weight relationship and relative condition factor of the Gangetic Hairfin Anchovy, S. phasa (Ham.1822) collected from Panchughat of Dhubri district of Assam were studied by examination of 105 specimens during January to May, 2012. The correlation coefficient (r) shows highly correlation between length and weight of S. phasa (0.95 to 0.99). In different length groups, the 'n' value was ranged from 2.76 to 3.21 and it showed an isometric growth in the studied species. The highest condition factor (K) were recorded in S. phasa 1.096. The 'K' value reveals that the species were in good condition in their natural environment.
