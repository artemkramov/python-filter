Optimization research of fermentation conditions of purple potato liquor
In this paper, we take purple potato as raw material, optimize the fermentation process of Purple Potato Wine. To obtain the optimal process parameters combination, we use orthogonal design method on the basis of single-factor experiment to optimize the conditions of liquefaction, saccharification and culturing yeast fermentation. The results showed that under the condition of the pH value being 6.5, temperature being 60Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¼Âα-amylase addition amount being 0.15%Ã¯Â¼Âreaction time being 2h, the liquefaction was optimized. At this time, the hydrolysis rate could reach 90.32%; Under the condition of the pH value being 4.0, temperature being 60Ã¢ÂÂ, added amount of saccharifing enzyme being 0.2%, reaction time being 2h,the saccharification was optimized. Under this condition, the reducing sugar content in the liquor was 10.87%; and under the condition of the pH value being 3.5, temperature being 20Ã¢ÂÂ, ratio of material to water being 1:1, reaction time being 6d, the fermentation effect of purple potato wine was the best.
