Changes in serum proteins and urea during the oestrous cycle in Red Sokoto goats
The study was conducted to determine the effect of oestrous cycle phase and ovarian steroids activity on serum proteins and urea profile during the oestrous cycle in Red Sokoto goats (RS). Eleven (n=11) clinically healthy RS goats aged between 1.5-3 years and weighing 15-25 kg were used for the study. The goats were synchronized with a single injection of 7.5 mg of PGF2α. The goats were bled by jugular venipuncture on d 0 (EE) or oestral, d 1-2 (LE) or late oestral, d 7-10 (M/ED) or metoestrus/early dioestral, d 11-15 (MD) or mid-dioestral and d 16 -22 (LD/PE) or late diestrus/proestrus phases of oestrous cycle. Blood samples collected were analyzed for serum total protein, albumin, globulin and urea. Duplicate sera from the same blood samples were analyzed for progesterone and oestradiol-17β concentrations. Serum total protein was significantly lower at EE than MD phase of the cycle and globulin concentration was lower at EE than MD phase. Serum urea concentration was higher at EE than LE, M/ED, MD and LD/PE phases of the cycle (P &lt; 0.05). Total protein and globulin concentrations were positively correlated during the oestrous cycle (r = 0.868; P &lt; 0.05), While, globulin and progesterone concentrations were inversely correlated during the cycle (r = - 0.868; P &lt; 0.05). The result of present study has revealed that fluctuations in serum total protein, globulin and urea may be due to variation in ovarian steroids during the oestrous cycle. Therefore it is recommended that interpretation of plasma proteins and urea should take into consideration the oestrous cycle phase.
