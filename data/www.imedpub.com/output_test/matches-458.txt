Synthesis, Growth, Spectroscopic, Optical and Thermal studies of Glycinium Maleate single crystals
Organic single crystal of glycinium maleate (GM) of size 14x7x8 mm3 was grown by the solvent evaporation technique at room temperature. The solubility of GM material was studied. Unit cell parameters of the grown GM crystal were determined by single crystal X- ray studies. Powder X- ray diffraction spectrum confirms the crystalline nature. Functional groups of the crystallized molecules were confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Transmission range of the grown crystal was determined by UV-vis-NIR spectrum. The thermal characteristics of GM were analyzed by thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Vickers microhardness test was performed on the prominent plane (001) of the grown crystal.
