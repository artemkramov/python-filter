Nutritional properties of Ã¢ÂÂBush MealsÃ¢ÂÂ from North CameroonÃ¢ÂÂs Biodiversity
With the aims at evaluating their biochemical content, a census of northern Cameroon’s food from biodiversity was conducted and their nutritional composition screened. All samples were collected directly from local “families’ reserve”. Each item was described taking into account main ingredients, recipe and the method of preparation. The nutritional information was assessed by direct biochemical assessment of proximate composition and mineral evaluation. Data analysis of items and profiles were performed by the Food Processor software for window. Among the biodiversity foodstuffs found, 16 cereal and cereal products, 12 tubers, roots and their products, 17 meats, poultry, fish, insects and their products, 68 vegetable, fruits and their products items were recorded. Foods products from local biodiversity in the greatest demand in the area includes, main dishes or “Plats de base” (in French language), with Kissaar (Dactyloctenium, Cenchrus or Eragrostis seed grains, ground in thick porridge); zanina (Amorphophallus roots boiled), Ngibbi (Cenchrus seeds, pounded to porridge), jeda (Amorphophallus tubers, boiled)- Soup dishes or Sauce or accompaniment, including meat, fish, insects or poultry prepared with soup from a wide mix variety of vegetables leaves including many hot main dishes- Fruits and seeds among which the most frequent were jujube fruit.
