Geospatial analysis to assess the potential site for coal based thermal power station in Gujarat, India
The advanced space technology known as Remote sensing and GIS is a perfect tool for Geo Spatial applications in science and engineering. In the present study, identification of suitable site for Thermal Power Plant along the mining area in Rajpardi district of Gujarat, India is one of the evidence of Geospatial technology for mankind development. Multi-spectral satellite data and collateral data of geology, geomorphology, topography, settlement and transport, forest cover, hydrology and climate were used to generate the integrated thematic database in GIS platform for selecting the suitable site for Thermal Power Station (TPS) construction. Selection of site for TPS was based on four primary criteria, such as land, water, coal mine and environment, and two secondary criteria, namely settlement and accessibility to the site. A Site-Suitability Index (SSI) is processed the multi spatial parameters according to the regulatory guidelines of MoEF (Ministry of Environment and Forest) and CEA (central Electricity Authority). Each class in spatial layers is assigned with weighed value 1 to 10 based on the relative importance to suitability. The sum of Weightage of spatial layers using weighted overlay analysis, the result have been classified as high, medium, low and not suitable
