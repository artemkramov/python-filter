Effect of Hall Current, Thermal Radiation and Thermo-Diffusion on Convective Heat and Mass Transfer Flow of a Viscous, Rotating Fluid Past a Vertical Porous Plate Embedded in a Porous Medium
We analyse the combined effects of Hall currents and radiation on the convective heat and mass transfer of a viscous electrically conducting rotating fluid through a porous medium past a vertical porous plate. in the presence of heat generating sources. The equations governing the flow, heat and mass transfer are solved exactly to obtain the velocity, temperature and concentration and are analysed for different variations of the governing parameters G, M, m, N1 , So andg.The rate of heat and mass transfer are numerically evaluated for different sets of the parameters. The influence of chemical action, Hall currents ,thermo-diffusion and radiation effects on the flow , heat and mass transfer characteristics are discussed in detail.
