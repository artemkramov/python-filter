The Influence of a Variety of Plasticisers on Properties of Poly (vinyl chloride)
Poly (vinyl chloride), PVC is widely used because it is easy to process, high productivity low cost and versatility. PVC can be only used for a few applications without the addition of a number of compounds to the basic material so that it can be processed and converted into a finished product. In this research various type of plasticisers were incorporated into PVC and their influence on the properties of PVC, such as tensile properties, low temperature flexibility, volatility, and flame resistance were investigated. The study showed that using tritolyl phosphate as a plasticiser increased tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and flame resistance of the PVC but with reduction of % elongation at break. Where as, dioctyl sebacate showed lower ductile-brittle transition temperature and with lower volatility loss in comparison with other plasticisers used.
