Design and simulation of process control using a PID controller by COMSOL multiphysics
PID control (proportional-integral-derivative-control) is one way to control a specific process, but it can be difficult to optimize the parameters in the PID algorithm. In this paper, we have design and simulated PID Controller module by using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2a.
