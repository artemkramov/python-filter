In vitro comparison of the antimicrobial activity of two varieties of Psidium guajava against dental caries causing pathogen
The antibacterial activity of two varieties of Psidium guajava were investigated by disc diffusion method against clinically isolated human cariogenic pathogen, Streptococcus mutans. The results indicated that the methanol flower extracts of both varieties have antibacterial activity against the tested dental caries causing bacterium. Among the two varieties, P. guajava berry showed potential inhibitory action than P.guajava variegata against S.mutans. HPLC analysis with methanol flower extract indicated the presence of five compounds .This study has shown the importance of guajava and indicated that the active compounds present in these two varieties could serve as a lead compound in the formulation of a new antibacterial herbal drug to cure dental caries
