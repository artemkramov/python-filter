Synthesis, characterization and antifungal activity of metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline based azo dye
Novel metal complexes of ligand 1-(4-((8-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)diazenyl)phenyl)-2-(4-methyl-piperazin-1- yl)ethanone (APEHQ) were prepared using transition metal salts and characterized by physic chemical parameters and various spectroscopic techniques. The geometry of the metal complexes was carried out by electronic spectral analysis and magnetic measurement studies. Novel ligand APEHQ was synthesized using diazotized 1-(4- aminophenyl)-2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethanone (APE) with 8-hyroxyquinoline (HQ) and was duly characterized. The antifungal activity of APEHQ and its metal complexes was screened against various fungi. Results showed that the metal complexes were found more active as compared to ligand.
