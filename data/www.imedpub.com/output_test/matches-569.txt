A study on sustainable utility of sugar mill effluent to vermicompost
Rapid increase in the human population beyond the limit of the urbanization, total agriculture land is decreasing day by day which are directly affecting the crop production. Although due to the usage of various chemical fertilizers and pesticides crop production has increased many fold; but their excessive and imbalance usages causing tremendous alterations in natural’s soil environment. Vermicomposting, although it has been around long enough to attract world wide attention, is any ways, still in a stage of infancy. Programs aimed to investigate the possibility of large scale vermicomposting. The vermicompost quality of the effluent treated bed is comparatively rich in N, P, K value than the control. From the present investigation it was made clear that the experimental groups Lampito mauritii have high protein content than the control samples hence they are suitable as fish bait, poultry and fish feed.
