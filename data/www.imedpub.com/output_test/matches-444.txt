Effect of body acceleration on pulsatile blood flow through a catheterized artery
A mathematical model has been developed for studying the effect of body acceleration on pulsatile blood flow through a catheterized artery with an axially non-symmetrical mild stenosis. The blood is assumed to be Newtonian fluid. Perturbation method is used to solve the resulting system of non-linear partial differential equation with appropriate boundary condition to investigate the flow. Analytical expressions for velocity profile, volumetric flow rate, wall shear stress and effective viscosity have been obtained. The computational results are presented graphically. It is noticed that the axial velocity increases as the body acceleration increases and the axial velocity decreases as the phase angle of body acceleration increases.
