Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial properties of the ternary complexes of cerium with Schiff base derived from 4-aminoantipyrine and some amino acids
The ternary complexes of cerium (III) with 2, 3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-4-salicylidene-3-pyrazolin-5-one and some amino acids, viz. L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, L-cysteine, L-leucine and L-serine have been synthesized. These complexes have been characterized on the basis of elemental analysis, conductivity data, magnetic susceptibility measurements, spectral methods and thermal analysis data. The Schiff base 2, 3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-4-salicylidene-3-pyrazolin-5- one (HL) acts as a primary ligand and amino acids acts as secondary ligand which coordinates through the carboxylate oxygen and the amino nitrogen. These complexes were screened for their antimicrobial activities and show the potent biological activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli
