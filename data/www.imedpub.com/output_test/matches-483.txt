Influence of Surface Characteristics of Adsorbent and Adsorbate on Competitive Adsorption Equilibrium
In the present study the adsorption behaviour of manganese from aqueous solution on to ligand loaded Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) was investigated. The study was carried out to examine the potential and effectiveness of Granular Activated Carbon to remove manganese through adsorption from aqueous solution. The experimental adsorption data showed good correlation with the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The results demonstrate that the filtrasorb 816(F-816) has a significant capacity to adsorbed of manganese (II) as compared to filtrasorb 300 (F-300) from wastewater.
