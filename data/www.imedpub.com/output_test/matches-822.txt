Ozone for Phorbol Esters Removal from Egyptian Jatropha Oil Seed Cake
Egyptian Jatropha oil seed cake, a main by-product from biodiesel production is nutritionally promising because of high nutrition content and low antinutrient level. The effect of some chemical treatments (sodium bicarbonate NaHCO3, ozonation, ethanol extraction) and physical treatments (heat treatment and ÃÂ¢ -irradiation) were subjected to the meal for inactivating the phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myrestate 13-acetate). The treatment methods were moistting equal portions of the meal with NaHCO3 (0.1- 0.5 M) for 30 minutes, accompanieAd by ozone treatment (2-6 minutes), heat treatment at (90 °C -121 °C) for 30 minutes, ethanol extraction, -ÃÂ¢ irradiation 50kGy for 30 minutes. The results showed best phorbol ester removal 75.26 % with NaHCO3 moist combined with 3 minutes ozone treatment at ozone dose 50 mg/L. The – ÃÂ¢ irradiation achieved 71.35 % successful phorbol esters removal at 50 kGy for 30 minutes irradiation. The NaHCO3 moistting combined with heat treatment 90°C for 30 minutes detoxified the meal 55.95% from phorbol esters. While NaHCO3 moist combined with heat treatment and water wash removed 76.48 % of the phorbol esters. The NaHCO3 moist treatment alone detoxified the meal by 44.54 % from phorbol esters. The isolated phorbol esters were analyzed and confirmed on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. The phorbol esters were easy eliminated with NaHCO3 moist combined with heat treatment and water wash &gt; NaHCO3 moist combined with ozone treatment 3 minutes &gt; ÃÂ¢– irradiation &gt; NaHCO3 moist combined with heat treatment.
