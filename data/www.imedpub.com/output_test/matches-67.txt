Structural study of the quaternary Se68Te19-xSn13Bix(x=8, 9, 10, 11, 12) chalcogenide crystals through X-ray Diffraction
The X-ray diffraction technique is used to study the structure of the material. The quaternary system Se68Te19- xSn13Bix (x=8, 9, 10, 11, 12) is analyzed with the powder diffraction method which is known as the finger print identification of the material. The material is heterogeneous and has the different phases. The various parameters regarding the material viz. miller indices (h, k, l values), volume, density, lattice spacing, FWHM, particle size and Lorentz’s polarization factor have been calculated. The system taken is showing both the cubic and hexagonal structure. This confirms the polycrystalline behavior of the system showing the presence of a multiphase structure. The material has same phases in all compositions as the peaks are almost at the same positions in all the samples, However there is slight variation in their intensity. The samples are prepared by the melt quenching technique. The Lorentz polarization factor gives the lower value of intensity of reflection at the intermediate angles compared to those in forward and backward directions. The particle size in the material found to be increasing up to x=11 thenafter decrease. In average the distance of closest approach for cubic system is found to be 9.62 Å and for the hexagonal system it is found to be 5.02 Å. The density of material is found to be more in the hexagonal system as that of cubic system
