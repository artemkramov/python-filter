Evaluation of some rice varieties under different nitrogen levels
Two field experiment was conducted at Rice research and training center (RRTC) – Sakha, kafr- El sheikh, governorate, Egypt in (2010) and (2011) seasons to study Evaluation of some rice varieties (Sakha 106, Sakha 105, GZ 7565, GZ 9075 and GZ 9362) under different nitrogen levels [Zero, 55, 111, 165 and 220 (Kg/ha]. Seedling age at transplanting was 26 days from sowing and by 20X20 cm planting spacing. All agricultural practices were applied as recommended for each cultivar. A split plot design with four replication was used. five Nitrogen levels allocated in the main plots. Five nitrogen levels were allocated in sub-plots. Main results induced that maximum tillering, panicle initiation, Roots length, heading dates, grains filling rates (G F R) at five stages, Leaf area index, chlorophyll content, number of tillers/M2 1000- grains weight, number of grains /panicle, panicle length (cm) and grain yield (Ton/ha) were the highest value at 220 (KgN/ha. Except Light penetration was lowest value with five rice varieties under study. So Sakha 106 gave the highest value to all studied characters. While zero nitrogen with GZ.9362 gave the lowest value with all traits under study. The Sakha 106 and 55kg.N/ha. gave the highest value Agronomic efficiency
