Second order slip flow of a MHD micropolar fluid over an unsteady stretching surface
The unsteady, two dimensional, mixed convection flow of an viscous incompressible electrically conducting micropolar fluid over a vertical and impermeable stretching surface in the presence of MHD and second order slip flow when the buoyancy force assists or opposes the flow has been studied. Using the similarity transformations, the governing equations have been transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations. These differential equations are highly nonlinear which cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, bvp4c MATLAB solver has been used for solving it. Numerical results are obtained for the skin-friction coefficient, the couple wall stress and the local Nusselt number as well as the velocity, microrotation and temperature profiles for different values of the governing parameters, namely, material parameter, magnetic parameter, first order velocity slip parameter, second order velocity slip parameter and Eckert number
