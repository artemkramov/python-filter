Finite difference analysis on an unsteady mixed convection flow past a semiinfinite vertical permeable moving plate with heat and mass transfer with radiation and viscous dissipation
An unsteady, two-dimensional, hydro magnetic, laminar mixed convective boundary- layer flow of an incompressible, Newtonian, electrically-conducting and radiating fluid along a semi-infinite vertical permeable moving plate with heat and mass transfer is analyzed, by taking into account the effect of viscous dissipation. The plate moves with a constant velocity in the direction of fluid flow while the free stream velocity follows an exponentially increasing small perturbation law. The dimensionless governing equations for this investigation are solved numerically by using the implicit finite difference method. Numerical evolution of the analytical results is performed and graphical results for velocity, temperature and concentration profiles within the boundary layer and tabulated results for skin-friction coefficient, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are presented and discussed.
