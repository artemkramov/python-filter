Study of seed borne mycoflora of mung bean (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) treated with potassium nitrate during storage
The main purpose of the present study was to enumerate the fungal species and their effect on germination associated with Mung bean seeds. Seeds of the cultivar viz. Pusa Vishal were collected from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, New Delhi. The seeds were surface sterilized by treating with HgCl2 solution. These seeds were treated with potassium nitrate (KNO3) and examined for seed mycoflora. Two methods viz. Agar plate and Blotter method were used to isolate the fungi. Total eight fungi were isolated from the test cultivar. Fungus were isolated and identified as Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus candidus, Fusarium semitectum, Penicillium citrinum, Macrophomina phaseolina and Rhizopus stolonifer. During isolation, the Blotter technique yielded higher number of fungi as compared to Agar plate method.
