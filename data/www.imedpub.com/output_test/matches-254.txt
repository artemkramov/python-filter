An Analytical Study of Potential Energy Term in Variable Moment of Inertia Nuclear Softness (MINS) Model
In this paper, we have calculated potential energy term in variable moment of inertia nuclear softness which shows the variation of potential energy term for the different even-even nuclei in the region of I-quadrant based on the valence particle and hole pairs consideration [8]{Ce (N=90), Nd (N=92), Dy (N=92) &amp; Dy (N-94)} with spin (J). The value of potential energy term is increasing almost linear with increasing spin (J) for all the nuclei.
