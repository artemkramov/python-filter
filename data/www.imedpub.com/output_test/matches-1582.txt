A study of magnetic properties in confined Sol-Gel synthesized NiS nano-clusters
Nanoclusters of Nickel Sulfide are chemically synthesized following natural self assembling in Sol-Gel process. A biopolymer is chosen as a base matrix due to a rigid perfect capping of nano-clusters. The resulting specimen was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical absorption using UV-VIS spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiment (XRD). The study also includes DC I-V characteristics and conductivity analysis of solid specimen at room temperature (RT). Magnetism in the developed specimens was investigated at low temperature. A super paramagnetic nature of the specimen is observed at low temperature. In all the cases the developed specimens are amorphous in nature and particle size was found to vary between 40-90 nm and exist with stable quantum confinement. The developed Nickel Sulfide is found behave as magnetic semiconductor with indirect band gap
