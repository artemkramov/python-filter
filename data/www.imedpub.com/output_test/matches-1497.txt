LengthÃ¢ÂÂweight relationships (LWR) of threatened Asian catfish, Clarias batrachus under poor availability in natural conditions from Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, India
The relation between length (L) and weight (W) was estimated for asian catfish, Clarias batrachus, now called Clarias magur, under poor availability in natural conditions. Samples were caught by different gears and a total 22 specimens (standard length 16.2-28.0 cm and total length 18.0-32.5 cm, av. wt., 46-251g) used in this study were caught with traditional fishing gear during January, 2008 - August, 2008. The estimation of parameter b of the length and weight relationship (W=aLb) ranged between 2.0111 to 3.4727. The average allometric coefficient ‘b’ of the LWR was found close to the isometric value (b = 3.4890). The results further indicated that the LWRs were highly correlated (r2 = 0.924389, p&lt;0.01) and Fulton’s condition factor (K) ranged, between 0.0830114 to 1.374421. Length-weight parameters can be used for several biological or fishery purposes to enable the derivation of weight estimates from given a value of length or vice-versa. We can conclude that this study has provided basic information on LWR and condition factor, which will be useful to fishery biologists in imposing adequate regulations for sustainable fishery management in the natural ponds, derelict water systems and culture system of this fish, in future, in Indian climatic condition.
