The Darkness Brings Light in the Field of Bio-Communication Through Melatonin Production
An interesting field of biophysics dealing with the electromagnetic waves emission correlating emphasis on the effect of darkness on an organism to organism communication. Multiple theories established narrating the production of electromagnetic waves within an organism by several means like the change in membrane potential, DNA excitation and relaxation, change in amino acids, the formation of water ions and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Darkness favorably provides the basis of generation, amplification, and reception of bio-electromagnetic waves that is disturbed in the light. One of the active key players involved in these waves generation is melatonin, produced by the pineal gland of the brain, controls the intensity and frequency of wave emission. Melatonin is captive in maintaining the suitable conditions for a proper bio-communication by activating and regulating the number of molecules and signaling cascades in the cells. The propagated bio-electromagnetic waves are then receipted by the bio-organism interested in communication and these waves target the cellular, subcellular machinery, and molecular level cascades of the recipient. Talking about that, these emitted waves target similar biomolecules of the receiver and creating an environment for proper communication. Different epigenetic factors like aiding food and effect of moon cycle (lunar cycle) can also contribute in bio-communication, therefore, crucially examined. The changes that a body undergoes with this conceiving like molecular pathways involved, metabolic chemistry changes can be taken into account through photo-proteins (e.g. some types of cytochromes) and quantum bioinformatics bases. The appliance of study could be a major quantum leap in the era where the need of electromagnetic devices could be minimized and a breaking dawn towards a new horizon.
