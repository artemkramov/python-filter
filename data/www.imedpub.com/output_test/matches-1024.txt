Indoor radon and Thoron levels and the associated effective dose rate determination at government hospitals in Basrah Governorate-Iraq
Study of indoor radon and thoron has been carried out inside ten (10) Government hospitals in Basrah Governorate-Iraq, using LR-115 type II and CR-39 solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs). In the present study the average value of indoor radon and thoron concentration are ranges from 40±6 Bq.m-3 in General Al Fayhaa Hospital to 109±15 Bq.m-3 in General harbours hospital for radon, and ranges from 10±1 Bq.m-3 in General Al Fayhaa Hospital to 46±9 Bq.m-3 in General harbours hospital for thoron. The average annual effective dose received by the workers due to radon and thoron varies from 0.35±0.04mSv.y-1 in General Al Fayhaa Hospital to 1.20±0.17 mSv.y-1 in General harbours hospital. The average value of indoor radon and thoron concentration and there corresponding effective dose are 73±14 Bq.m-3, 24±6 Bq.m-3 and 0.72±0.15 mSv.y-1 respectively. This performed study was the first in this region
