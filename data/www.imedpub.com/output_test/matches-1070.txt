Synthesis, characterization and structural modification of Nanophilic Poly(epichlorohydrin)
The solution polymerization of epichlorohydrin (ECH) in the presence of thioglycolicacid (TGA) as an initiator at 45oC for four hours under nitrogen atmosphere was carried out. Further, the structure of poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH) is modified by nano silver end capping process. Thus obtained polymer was characterized by various analytical techniques. In order to improve the application of PECH in the biological field, the structure of PECH was extended by the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone (CL). The antimicrobial property of nano silver end capped PECH before and after structural modification was also tested. In order to improve the water solubility, the structure of the diblock copolymer was modified by p-hydroxy benzoic acid and succinimide.
