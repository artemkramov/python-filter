MHD effects on micropolar nanofluid flow over a radiative stretching surface with thermal conductivity
In this paper, an analysis is presented the effects of variable thermal conductivity and radiation on the flow and heat transfer of an electrically conducting micropolar nanofluid over a continuously stretching surface with varying temperature in the presence of a magnetic field considered. The surface temperature is assumed to vary as a powerlaw temperature. The governing conservation equations of mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy are converted into a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations by means of similarity transformation. The resulting system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations is solved by implicit finite difference method with the Thomas algorithm. The results are analyzed for the effect of different physical parameters such as magnetic parameter, microrotation parameter, Prandtl number, radiation parameter; Eckert number, thermal conductivity parameter, Brownian motion parameter, Thermophoresis parameter, Lewis number, and surface temperature parameter on the velocity, angular velocity, temperature and concentration fields are presented through graphs. Physical quantities such as skin friction coefficient, local heat, local mass fluxes are also computed and are shown in table
