Isolation, characterization and identification of actinobacteria of Mangrove ecosystem Ennoor, east coast of Tamil Nadu, India
A study on marine actinobacteria and physicochemical characteristics of soil in marine environment of Ennoor, East Coast of Tamilnadu, India, was performed. The marine soil were selected for sampling and the following parameters were recorded at monthly intervals, The following Parameters like pH, Electrical conductivity, Organic carbon, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, available zinc, available copper, available iron, available manganese, Cation exchange capacity, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, were studied. Totally 21 actinobacteria strains were screened and identified as genus Actinokineospora, Actinopolyspora, Amycolata, Glycomyces, Microbispora, Microtetraspora, Micropolyspora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis(2), Promicromonospora, Saccharothrix(2), Saccharopolyspora, Streptomyces microflavus, Streptomyces(4), Streptoverticillium, Spirillospora and Thermomonospora
