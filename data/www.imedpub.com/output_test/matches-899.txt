Synthesis, growth, spectral and thermal studies on organic nonlinear optical material-L-valine valinium perchlorate single crystal
Organic material of L-Valine valinium perchlorate (LVVPC) was synthesized. LVVPC crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21. FTIR, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral analyses were carried out in order to confirm the presence of functional groups and the synthesized compound respectively. From the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum the cut-off wavelength was found to be 390nm. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the grown crystal was studied. The second harmonic generation (SHG) analysis was carried and found to be ~3.5 times higher than that of the standard potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KDP)
