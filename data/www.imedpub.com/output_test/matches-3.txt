Synthesis of dumbbell shape hyperbranched polymer: Based on diethylene triamine and acryloyl chloride used as rheology modifier for water based paints
Hyper-branched polymer derived from ABx-type monomers have been generally recognized as the cheaper and economically more feasible counterparts of the well-known other members of the dendritic macromolecule family, the perfectly branched dendrimers. Since they can be manufactured more quickly and easily in a one-step polymerization procedure, their significantly lower cost price puts them in a much more favorable position to be industrially applied as coating resins. The conceptual design of a branched macromolecule is ideally outlined for film forming applications. The viscosity in relation to their molecular weight is kept low due to their compact morphology hampering chain entanglements, while on the other hand, the large number of functional end groups enable efficient cross-linking. In connection with studies of cyclic polymerisation the aliyl derivative of diethylenetriamine (DETA) has been prepared and hyper-branched polymer of Diethylene Tri amine (DETA) and Acryloyl Chloride (ACl) were successfully prepared by divergent approach. This hyper-branched polymer was comprehensively characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, mass spectroscopy, and FTIR
