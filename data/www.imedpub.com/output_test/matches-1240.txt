Petrographical investigation of granite for quarry operation in a localised area of Ado Ekiti, South-western Nigeria
Twelve rock samples of granite are collected from the deposit located at the site of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti. The samples are thin sectioned and petrographically studied at X80 magnification under crossed and plane polarised light. The studied rocks are dominantly porphyritic in texture while the mineral composition are basically quartz, biotite, plagioclase feldspar and hornblende at estimated percentages occurrences of 34.12%, 25.51%, 12.82%, 10.23% respectively. However, microcline, opaque and orthoclase occur at minor amounts of 9.30%,4.20% and 3.82% respectively. The granite at this localised area would be suitable for quarry operation in view of the aforementioned textural and mineralogical observation
