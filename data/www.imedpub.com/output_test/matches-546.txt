Effect of variable viscosity on the peristaltic flow of a Jeffrey fluid in a uniform tube
In this paper, the peristaltic flow of a Jeffrey fluid in a tube with variable viscosity under the assumptions of long wavelength is investigated. The flow is investigated in a wave frame of reference moving with velocity of the wave. The effects of 1l , viscosity parametera and amplitude ratio f on the pumping characteristics and friction force are discussed in detail through graphs.
