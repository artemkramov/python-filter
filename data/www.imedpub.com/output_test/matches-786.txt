Reproductive response of buffaloes following induction of superovulation with gonadotrophin
Eighteen normally cycling buffalo were used to determine the effectiveness of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSH) as super ovulatory drug. Group A received PMSG (3000 ID) on day 9 while group B received the treatment on day 10 of the cycle.PGF2 alpha were given at 60 and 70 hrs after PMSG and Ovaries were obtained two days after estrus to monitor ovarian response. The study compares the super ovulatory response of buffalo to either PMSG (3000 IU) or PFSH (44 mg) decreasing dose at 12 hrs interval. Treatment were initiated on day 9-10 PGF2 alpha on 60 and 72 hr after gonadotrophin ,as on Ist 12 and 24 hours after estrus are embryo collected on days 5 after A.I. Superovulatory treatment initiated either on day 9 or 10 were similar in refered to number of ovulation are no of follicle. PFSH treatment result to more ovulation (2.86±1.57) are collected embryo (2.0±2.0 than PMSG (1.5±2.0).Both drug were effective in induction of multiple ovulation but a more favorable result was exhibited with FSH treatment.
