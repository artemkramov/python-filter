Impact of supplemental zinc on pathology of heart in broiler chicks
This experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of zinc supplementation on pathology of heart in broiler chicks. Twenty broiler chicks were taken for the experiment. One control group and three treated groups. All the treated groups were supplemented with 300mg/kgb.w. (Low dose), 600mg/kgb.w. (Intermediate dose) and 900mg/kgb.w. (High dose) of Zinc for 21 days.
