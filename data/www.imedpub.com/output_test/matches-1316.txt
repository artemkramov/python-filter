Anisotropic Bianchi type Ã¢ÂÂI cosmological model with wet dark energy in general theory of relativity
Anisotropic Bianchi type –I cosmological model is studied in General Theory of relativity with the matter wet dark energy. To determine the model, we assume that 1 n A B A B t = =a &amp; &amp; and 2 n C C t =a &amp; where 1 a , 2 a are constant. Further various solutions are obtained and some physical and kinematical properties of the model have also been discussed
