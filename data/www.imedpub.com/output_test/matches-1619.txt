Form of waste water discharge in Khamir port solar distillation for environmental management by the empirical equations
Using of solar distillation is a convenient way to obtain fresh water resources in areas there have available saline water resources. But desalination of sea water produces waste water that is much higher salt concentrations from sea water. Waste must be disposed of in such a way that the least effect on the acceptor water environment (sea, in most cases). Initial dilution and its characteristics play important roles in designing of effluent disposal into the sea. Using the mixing model is very common for estimation of initial dilution. In this study the application of T form diffuser has been addressed for waste disposal of Khamir Port solar desalination site by using empirical equations. Initial dilution is related to water depth, diameter, flow rate, the distance between the opening outlets and velocity of the sea water. As the results of this paper, the critical and the best initial dilution were determined with regard to different environmental conditions
