Analysis of kernel function by the transformation of field resistivity data
The interpretation process has been a major problem in geophysical investigation of the subsurface of the earth in terms of lithological variations with depth. The resistivity kernel function performs as an intermediary in the process of interpreting apparent measurements in terms of lithological variations with depth. The kernel function cannot be measured in the field but must be obtained from a transformation of measured electric potentials or apparent resistivities. The function is more traceable mathematically than the apparent resistivity function, it has become the basis of a method of quantitative interpretation. In this work, some literature based on kernel function with their peculiar problems were highlighted. The theoretical derivation where the necessary information about the configuration of the earth were fully explained. The Schlumberger electrode configuration was adopted for data collection in the field. The field data obtained from Ughelli in Delta State, Nigeria were matched with theoretical curves from kernel function. The results obtained from kernel function agreed very well with well logs interpretation in Ughelli.
