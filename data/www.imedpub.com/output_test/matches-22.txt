Bio-remediation of a crude oil contaminated soil using water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)
The effect of water hyacinth on the remediation of crude oil contaminated soil was studied ex-situ for 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5% crude oil contaminated soil (Heavy Crude) obtained from the Niger Delta region. The volume of the different percentages of crude oil contamination was equivalent to 3.17, 6.35 and 9.70l/m2 of land area respectively. The remediation process was followed by monitoring the THC of the soil with time on 16 cells. After a period of 10 weeks, bean seeds were planted on the remediated soil to observe if these various cells would sustain plant growth for the first 15 days. Results obtained were analysed with a 2- Factor Analysis of Variance Excel tool for data analysis. The effect of water hyacinth on the remediation process had P-values greater than 0.05 at 1.5 and 3% which indicated that water hyacinth application may not be necessary for remediating crude oil contaminated soil at 1 and 3%. However, the P- value less than 0.05 for crude oil contaminated soil at 4.5% which indicated that the water hyacinth may be necessary for remediating crude oil contaminated soil above 3 - 4.5%. Also, the time effect of the remediation process had P-value less than 0.05 for 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5% crude oil contamination signifying that the time factor play important role in the remediation process.
