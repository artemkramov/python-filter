Production and characterization of biosurfactant from bacillus subtilis MTCC441 and its evaluation to use as bioemulsifier for food bio - preservative
Biosurfactants are amphiphilic compounds produced by various bacteria and fungi which reduce surface and interfacial tension. The Bacterial strain Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441 was used for the production of biosurfactant and biosurfactant activity was tested against different vegetable edible oils. The parameters for better growth of the bacterial strain was optimized and production of surfactant was carried out. The crude biosurfactant was extracted and the emulsification potency was assessed using different vegetable edible oils. Further, the rhamnolipid was detected from the extracted biosurfactant and was confirmed by Infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that strain showed high surfactant activity over the Gingelly oil, required mesophilic temperature and pH-7 for its better growth. The surfactant showed comparatively high emulsification index over Gingelly oil at the rate of 71%. The rhamnolipid was detected in the surfactant and IR spectrum showed a typical pattern of stretches for CH2, CH3 and C-O groups.
