A Computational study of Bingham plastic flow of Blood through an artery by multiple stenoses and post dilatation
The present paper deals with fully developed one dimensional Bingham plastic flow of blood through a small artery having multiple stenoses and post-stenotic dilatation. We have determined the resistance- to flow -ratio for yield stresses 0, .02, .04 n/m2, blood viscosities 0.00345, 0.004, 0.00455 Pa.s and fluxes 1, 10, 100. The resistance- to - flow moves nearer to unity as yield stress increases and flux decreases. Variation in viscosities shows no significant change in Resistance –to-flow ratio. The degree of these changes is maximum for yield stress and slightest for flux. The results are discussed numerically and graphically
