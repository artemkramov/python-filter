Effect of pyrotechnic chemicals in digestive tract microflora and proximate composition in fish Oreochromis mossambicus
In the present study, the fish Oreochromis mossambicus were obtained from the Thiruthangal pond for the toxicological study treated with pyrotechnic chemicals, cryolite and copper acetoarsenite, which they are used for the production of sparklers as a coloring agent. After exposure with these pyrotechnic chemicals the fishes were sacrificed and the guts were taken for the study. Foregut, midgut and hindgut were separated and serially diluted then plated. Meanwhile, the tissue homogenate was used for the estimation of the proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, simultaneously a set of control was analyzed. The results indicates that decreased amount of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids also, these chemicals affect the composition of the gut micro flora thereby bring about changes in the metabolic activities in the exposed fish. In terms of extreme toxicity, it is absolutely necessary to monitor the residual deposition in the soil also in freshwater ecosystem at low concentrations. Hence, this study strongly recommends the usage of pyrotechnic chemicals should be handled carefully and discharged in highly proper way without affecting whole ecosystem
