Relationship between nitric oxide and sialic acid concentrations in south Indian type 2 diabetic patients
Nitric oxide and sialic acid variables are indicators of the acute phase response. This study was planned to investigate the relationship between the level of serum nitric oxide and sialic acid in type 2 diabetes with and without nephropathy. Fasting venous blood samples were taken from 90 subjects of which 30 were of type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy (group I), 30 type 2 diabetes without any micro vascular complications (group II) and 30 healthy individuals without diabetes (group III). The serum samples were analyzed for serum nitric oxide and sialic acid levels. The higher levels (p&lt;0.01) of serum sialic acid were observed in group I and II as compared to controls. Significantly low levels of serum nitric oxide (p&lt;0.01) were observed in group I and II patients as compared to controls. Results indicated that variations in the serum nitric oxide and sialic acid are the major biochemical indicators for micro and macro vascular complications of diabetes nephropathy. The present study revealed a progressive increase in serum sialic acid with decreasing nitric oxide concentration in diabetic nephropathy patients. Furthermore, several variable risk factors may associate serum sialic acid and nitric oxide levels of the diabetic patients
