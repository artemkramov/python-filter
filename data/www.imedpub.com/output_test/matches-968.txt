Geo-medical problems Vis Ã¢ÂÂa-Vis role of multi-level elemental anomalies through geo-genic sources emergence health disorder: A review
Geo- mineral resources of the geosphere have released the number of elements as major, minor and trace amount in geo-chemical environment either naturally geological process or occupational geo-mining activities depending on their relative abundance of poly-metallic deposits in geologic complex terrain which adversely impacts on human and animals health directly or indirectly exposes through the air, water, soil and foodstuffs in perturbed system. These release elements comes either geo-genic or anthropogenic sources which may be found multi-level concentration as deficient or excess (toxicity) depends upon the intensity of geological exogenetic and endogenetic process involvement which results various types of health risk diseases by ingestion. The occupational health related geo-medical complications with special reference to opencast &amp; underground geo-mining activities of mineralized and non-mineralization areas which creates reversible and irreversible diseases due to inhalation which creates reversible and irreversible diseases due to inhalation of multi-elemental toxic dusts in long-term exposures in the human body. This review paper is emphasized on a multi-faceted challenges of geo-medical problems in India and abroad which have been realized and presently demands to minimization of inverse impact of both geo-genic and anthropogenic (Mine out areas) through the contributions of a multi-layered responses of high level experienced expertees from the different fields with the management strategies and take awareness to the societal costs of environmental pollution
