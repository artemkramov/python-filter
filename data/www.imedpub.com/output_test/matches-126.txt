Bingham Plastic characteristic of blood flow through a generalized atherosclerotic artery with multiple stenoses
In this paper, we have investigated the effects of length of stenosis, shape parameter, parameter g on the resistance to flow for a Bingham plastic flow of blood through a generalized artery having multiple stenoses locate at equal distances. Here, the rheology of the flowing blood is characterized by non-Newtonian fluid model. The study reveals that flow resistance decreases as shape parameter andg increases and it increases as stenosis height and length increase. We have also shown the variation of wall shear stress for different values of parameterg .
