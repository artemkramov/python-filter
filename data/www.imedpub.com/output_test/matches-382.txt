Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity studies of 5-(2-(5- benzoyl-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazole-1-yl)2-oxoethylamino)-2-hydroxy benzoic acid and their transition metal chelates
1-(5-benzoyl-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazole-1-yl)2-chloroethanone was condensed with 5-amino-2-hydroxy benzoic acid (5-Amino Salicylic acid). The resulting 5-(2-(5-benzoyl-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazole-1-yl)2-oxoethylamino)-2-hydroxy benzoic acid was characterized by elemental analysis and spectral studies. The transition metal chelates of the same were prepared with Cu2+, Ni2+ , Co2+ , Mn2+ and Zn2+ and characterized by IR spectral studies and magnetic properties. The antimicrobial activity of ligand and its metal chelates were screened against various gram-positive (+) and gram-negative (Ã¢ÂÂ) organism. The results show that all these samples are more or less active agents against various organisms.
