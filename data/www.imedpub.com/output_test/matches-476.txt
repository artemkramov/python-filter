Hydrochemical Analysis of Ground Water Potential in Onicha - Ukwuani, Ndokwa Land Area of Delta State, Nigeria
The determination of hydrological parameters is of primary importance in assessing the potential of groundwater reserve in a given area. The present study was initiated by a desire to determine the availability of sufficient and good quality water for a proposed expansion of the human and industrial establishments without jeopardizing the existing domestic water supply in Onicha-Ukwuani. Water samples were collected from fifteen locations evenly distributed within Onicha Ukwuani and analyzed for twenty-three (23) parameters. The contrast of the result obtained with the WHO standard revealed that the water sample in the study area contains higher concentrations of iron than the WHO recommended limit of 0.3 mg/L. This indicates that iron bearing minerals are common in the study area. The well water in the area require treatment to reduce the level of iron content in them. Consequently, exposure of the water to air for oxidation to take place could cause ferrous oxide in them to oxidize to ferric oxide and these would precipitate as rust colored ferric-hydroxide that stains plumbing fixtures, laundry and cooking utensils and properly filtered. Furthermore, the free carbondioxide should be allowed to enter the groundwater system so as to reduce the PH of the water. Apart from the acidic condition and the high iron content, none of the parameters studied exceeded the stipulated standards showing that the water is potable if treated for high iron concentration and acidity.
