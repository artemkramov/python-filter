Role of enzymes in fruit juice processing and its quality enhancement Shiv Kumar
The demand of fruit juices is increasing day by day as a result of increasing health awareness among the people. Most of juice extraction processes are not producing satisfactory quantity and quality of juices. Enzymatic extraction of juices results in higher yield. The enzymes used are mainly pectinase, cellulase, hemicellase etc. Apart from promoting juice extraction, enzyme addition increases the release of various phenolics and other nutritionally important components in the juice. Juice appearance is also improved by enzymatic clarification. Juice quality in terms of reduced viscosity, decreased turbidity, and improved filterability is also improved. Enzymes are also used for debittering of citrus fruit juices and in preventing darkening of juices
