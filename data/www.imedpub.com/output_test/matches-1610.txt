Analysis of hydro morphometric characteristics using GIS and statistical analysis (Case study: Maragh basin, Esfahan province, center of Iran)
In present research, the relation between stream rank and each of stream parameters such as stream length, slope, area, bifurcation ratio and stream branch number have been determined using GIS and statistical analysis. This study determines the best method of stream ranking in Maragh basin (located in Kashan city, Esfahan province, Iran) using four stream ranking systems (Horton, Strahler, Shidger and Shreve). The results showed that 1- there was the well-organized relation between the rank and the stream branch number and the rank and the area. They decreased as a result of increasing the rank. 2- The basin slope decreased as a result of the rank increasing. Also, according to the results of regression analysis and the correlation among different factors, there were the most correlation between stream rank and parameters of branch ratio, stream branch number, slope, basin area and stream length in Strahler method withR2=1, 0.993, 0.960, 0.906 and0.879, respectively. Therefore, Strahler method is more appropriate than other methods, but in this method, total number of existent streams in drainage system is not showed. Hence, Then, one of Shreve or Shidger methods can be used to show the stream number
