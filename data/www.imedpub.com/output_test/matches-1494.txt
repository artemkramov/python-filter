Computational analysis of pulsatile biofluid in a locally expanded vessel under the action of magnetic field
The transient impact of magnetic field on the drug delivery and heat transfer rate was investigated through an aneurysm artery. Vessel walls were considered as porous media, and blood viscosity was assumed to show non- Newtonian behaviour. The transient solution was used for solving governing equations in porous and free regions simultaneously while both magnetization and Lorentz exerted the external forces. These forcesresulted in vortex formation and flow flux to the aneurysm region. The effects of the magnetic field on the velocity, temperature, heat transfer rate and shear stress distribution through the dilated vessel were further studied. The results showed that applying of a magnetic field intensity (Mnf) of 109creates high shear stress and v-velocity on aneurysm region, and by doubling Mnf, these factors increase 2X and 1.38Xrespectively. Furthermore, by doubling the magnetic field intensity, the maximum temperature showed an increase of 5.2% on the dilation region and Nusselt number, indicating that heat transfer rate rises sharply with increasing Lorentz part of the magnetic field.
