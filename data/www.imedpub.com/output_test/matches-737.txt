Effect of industrial effluents and wastes on physico-chemical parameters of river Rapti
increasingly by effluents discharged from Saraya sugar factory and distillery. The present study was made to investigate the water quality by performing physico-chemical analysis. For this purpose samples were collected from two sites namely Faren Nallah and river Rapti to evaluate variations in temperature (21.2±0.69-32.8±0.87 0C), pH (6.11±0.4-6.7±0.047), EC (381±4.68- 741±6.62 μS/cm), DO (1.36±0.73-5.8±1.07 mg/l), BOD (34.2±5.43-102±2.04 mg/l), COD (106±0.98-298±3.01 mg/l), chloride (30.2±4.93-90.20±23.3 mg/l), nitrate (0.47±0.01-3.67±0.86 mg/l), phosphate (0.13±0.05-0.26±0.049 mg/l), sulphate (38.6±1.89-45.80±6.49 mg/l), free CO2 (2.2±0.78-35.3±3.62 mg/l), alkalinity (148±4.27-227±13.41 mg/l), total hardness (156±6.55- 202±14.14 mg/l), total solid (557±32.58-936±34.5 mg/l) and oil and grease (17.9±0.67- 25.97±0.43 mg/l). From the result it revealed that the water quality of Faren Nallah is more worst that caries effluent to river Rapti from sugar factory and distillery. Thus, sugar factory and distilleries are pouring poisonous effluents in the river, which deadly affect both the human beings and their environment.
