Determination of the optical constants and optical limiting of doped malachite green thin films by the spray method
The spray method technique has been successfully used to deposit highly uniform and good adhesion malachite green (MG) thin films. The optical constants of the doping thin films were obtained from the analysis of the experimental recorded transmittance and absorption spectral data over the wavelengths range 300-1000 nm. The values of some important parameters (refractive index n, the dispersion energy d E the oscillation energy o E and energy bang gaps g E ) have been determined by reflection spectra. The third-order nonlinear optical properties, c (3) ,of MG thin films film are evaluated from changes of index of refraction using Millers rule. Optical limiting have been observed and studied by means of single beam transmission technique, using a continuous-wave (cw) visible solid state laser beam with a wavelength of 532 nm and 30 mWatt output power.
