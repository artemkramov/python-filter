Studies on the physico-chemical status of Kottakudi Mangrove Estuary,Thiruppullani, Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu
The present study was conducted on the physico-chemical parameters of the Kottakudi Mangrove Estuary, Thiruppullani, Ramanathapuram District, Tamil Nadu. Mangrove and estuaries are the fertile ecosystem serving nursery and feeding ground to the many marine organisms. However the water quality parameters of the particular environment are prime factor which determining the growth of mangroves, breeding and spawning periodicity of the many marine shell and fin fishes. The present investigation the water quality parameters (Temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and ammonia) showing seasonal variation and it is pertinent to say that the variations recorded during the present study may be due to the environmental fluctuations in relation with season
