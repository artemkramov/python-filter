Modified MHD double- diffusive convection coupled with cross-diffusions
The present paper investigates the problem of modified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) double-diffusive convection coupled with cross-diffusions for the Veronis’ and Stern’s type configurations. The nasty behaviour of the governing equations of the problem is mollified by the construction of a proper transformation and the relationship between various energies is established. The analysis made brings out that total kinetic energy associated with a disturbance is greater than the sum of its total magnetic and concentration energies in the parameter regime, 1. 4 27 / 2 2 2 2 4 1 Q - + RS¢ - - k - £ s p st p The results derived herein are valid for quite general nature of boundary conditions.
