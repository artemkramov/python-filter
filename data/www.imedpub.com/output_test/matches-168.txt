Antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of leaf extracts of Aegle marmelos
In the present investigation was undertaken to develop an Antimicrobial and Antioxidant activity of leaf extract of Aegle marmelos. From the leaf were extract with Acetone, Chloroform, Ethanol and Hexane against Bacterial strain like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli and fungal strain like Aspergillus niger, A. flavus and Fusarium. The antimicrobial activity was determined by disc diffusion method. Acetone and hexane extracts were found to be highly active against bacterial species like Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aurogenosa and fungal species like Aspergillus niger. The MIC values were obtained by serial dilution method. Ethanol fraction of leaves exhibited highest radicals scavenging activity, that is, 63.84 ± 0.05. In overall comparison the ethanolic extract of leaves in Aegle marmelos shows the highest scavenging activity followed by the acetone.
