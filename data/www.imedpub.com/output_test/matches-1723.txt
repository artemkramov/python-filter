Photocatalytic Degradation of Commercial Textile Azo Dye Reactive Blue 160 by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis
The photocatalytic bleaching of textile azo dye Reactive Blue 160 has been carried out in the presence of semiconductor photocatalyst CeFeO3 and the progress of reaction was observed spectrophotometrically. The effect of various operating parameters like pH, concentration of the dye, amount of photocatalyst on the efficiency of the reaction has been studied. Kinetic analysis of photodegradation reveals that the degradation follows pseudo first order kinetics according to the Langmuir- Hinshelwood model. The optimum conditions for the degradation of Reactive Blue 160 dye have been found as dye concentration 3x10-5M, pH= 8 and amount of catalyst 0.06 g/100 ml.
