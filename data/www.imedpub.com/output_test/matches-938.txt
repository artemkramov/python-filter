Risk Factors Associated with Maternal Age and Other Parameters in Assisted Reproductive Technologies - A Brief Review
Assisted reproductive technology is advancing at fast pace. Increased use of ART (Assisted reproductive technology) is due to changing living standards which involve increased educational and career demand, higher rate of infertility due to poor lifestyle and child conceivement after second marriage. This study gives an overview that how advancing age affects maternal and neonatal outcomes in ART (Assisted reproductive technology). Also it illustrates how other factor like obesity and twin pregnancies complicates the scenario. The studies find an increased rate of preterm birth .gestational hypertension, cesarean delivery chances, high density plasma, Preeclampsia and fetal death at advanced age. The study also shows the combinatorial effects of mother age with number of embryos along with number of good quality embryos which are transferred in ART (Assisted reproductive technology). In advanced age women high clinical and multiple pregnancy rate is achieved by increasing the number along with quality of embryos.
