Synthesis and studies of antifungal activity of 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines
A Series of 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5 triazines are synthesized. The synthesized compounds are evaluated for their in-vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans. Out of 10 compounds, all of them showed antifungal activity in the range of 1000 μg/ml to 10 μg/ml. All the compounds are found active against the said fungus. The promising results are in support of the fact that the compounds are worth to be optimized for some novel drugs in future. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized using IR, 1 H-NMR.
