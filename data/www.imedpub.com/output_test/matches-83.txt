Chemical reaction and radiation effects on MHD free convection flow along a streching surface with viscous dissipation and heat generation
The effects of chemical reaction and radiation on a steady two-dimensional flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting fluid near an isothermal vertical stretching sheet, in the presence of viscous dissipation and heat generation are studied. The governing equations are transformed by using similarity transformation and the resultant dimensionless equations are solved numerically using the Runge – Kutta fourth order method with shooting technique. The effects of various governing parameters on the velocity, temperature, concentration, skinfriction coefficient, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are computed and discussed in detail. Comparison of the obtained numerical results is made with previously published results. It is found that, the velocity and concentration decreases with increasing the Schmidt number (Sc), chemical reaction parameter (Kr), and the velocity as well as temperature decreases with increasing the radiation parameter (F), while the velocity as well as temperature increases with increasing the heat generation parameter (Q).
