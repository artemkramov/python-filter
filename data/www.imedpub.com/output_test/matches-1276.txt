MHD free convection flow of a dissipative fluid over a vertical porous plate in porous media
Numerical solutions are obtained for the MHD free convection flow of a dissipative fluid along a vertical porous plate in porous media with mass transfer, the surface of which is exposed to a constant heat flux. The non-linear system of partial differential equations is numerically solved by the implicit finite-difference method. Velocity, temperature and concentration profiles, local skin-friction, local Nusselt and local Sherwood numbers are plotted for air. The influence of the Suction rate parameter, buoyancy ratio parameter, porous media parameter , dissipation number, Schmidt number and magnetic parameter on heat and mass transfer are discussed
