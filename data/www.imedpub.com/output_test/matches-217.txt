Potential use of overpasses in Pulau Pinang
Land use in high-density areas should be in full accordance of acts, regulations, and related policies. The use of land under viaducts offers a lot of potential to ensure sources of income and employment opportunities for the needy. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential use of land under viaducts. The sample of this study is the viaduct in the Middle Circle, Seberang Jaya, and Pulau Pinang, which was selected using a simple random sampling technique. This research used a descriptive method to analyse data. The findings of this study identified five potentially suitable lands that could be developed for landscaping, pedestrians, murals, parking, and advertising boards. In this case, help and support from the government is necessary to use this land to provide benefits to the surrounding people and other users in general.
