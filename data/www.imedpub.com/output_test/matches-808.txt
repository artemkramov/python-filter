Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of Some Transition Metal Complexes (Mn, Co, Zn, Ni) With L-Proline and Kojic Acid
Four Mixed ligand complexes of the type MAL, where M = Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), A= LProline and L = Kojic acid have been synthesized. All complexes have been characterized by modern methods like elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy, magnetic moments, thermogravimetric analysis, UV-Visible reflectance spectra and conductivity measurements. All complexes are found to be coloured and Mn(II) complexes have been assigned octahedral geometry and tetrahedral geometry for Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) complexrs. The ligands and the metal complexes have been screened for antibacterial and antifungal activity
