Synthesis of various 1,5-benzothiazepine derivatives from 1-{4'-[(4''-methyl piperazinyl)diazenyl]phenyl}-3-(substitutedphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one and studies of their antimicrobial activity
2-{4'-[(4''-methylpiperazinyl)diazenyl]phenyl}-4-(substitutedphenyl)-1,5-benzo thiazepine have been synthesized from 1-{4'-[ (4''-methylpiperazinyl) diazenyl]phenyl}-3-(substitutedphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one with 2-mercaptoaniline. The compounds have been screened for their antimicrobial activities against different microorganisms at 128 μg/mL, 256 μg/mL and 512 μg/mL. The structures of novel synthesized compounds have been established on the basis of elemental analysis, IR, 1H NMR and mass spectral data.
