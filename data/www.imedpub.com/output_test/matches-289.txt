Slow steady motion of a thermo-viscous fluid in a porous slab bounded between two impermeable parallel plates
The problem of slow steady motion of a second order thermo-viscous incompressible fluid through a porous slab bounded by two non-permeable parallel plates is examined in this paper. The two plates are kept at two different temperatures and the flow is generated by a constant pressure gradient. Explicit calculations have been made to obtain the velocity and temperature distributions with appropriate boundary conditions. The flow in the absence of pressure gradient and porosity of the medium has been deduced as the special cases. The flow rate, Shear stress, heat transfer coefficient and the transverse force perpendicular to the flow direction are calculated.
