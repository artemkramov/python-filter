Development of new age cost effective superplasticizer for ready mixed concrete: A study on physico-chemical and mechanical property
A superplasticizer, methylmeth acrylate has been prepared by triphenyl stibonium 1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl cyclopentadienylide as radical initiator by free radical polymerization in dioxane at 60 ± 1oC for 1 hour, under atmosphere of nitrogen. Polymethyl methacrylate as a superplasticizer and fly ash as a mineral admixture are used in ready mixed concrete and properties of RMC has been studied. The superplasticizer extents the setting time of cement, without loss in properties of concrete. The concrete is workable, plastic and flowable. 20-30% substitution of cement by fly ash, increases the strength and reduces the cost of concrete, making it environment friendly. The bulk density is maintained between 2345-2446 kg/m3. The w/c ratio is between 0.38 to 0.49. The slump is in between 110-130.
