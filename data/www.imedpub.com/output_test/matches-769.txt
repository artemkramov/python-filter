Importance of hatchery enrichment in laboratory rearing and conservation of critically endangered fish Nandus nandus
Attempts to counteract hatchery-related behavioural deficiencies have utilized intensive training programmes shortly before the hatchery fishes are released to nature. Induced breeding of, Nandus nandus (Hum-Buch) was conducted by synthetic hormone in the intensity level of ovaprim 0.5 mL kg−1 of body weight respectively.Application of hatchery enrichment technique used in Anabas testudineus was adopted before release into nature. So more viability in nature found due to the development of flexible behaviour rather than normal hatchery condition .Hence conservation of Nandus nandus from LnRt category and sustain its fauna.
