A Simple model for squeezing flow of red blood cell in narrow capillary
This paper describes a model for the analysis of drag on flexible red blood cell considering different assumed shapes of red blood cells in narrow capillary of diameter of the same order as that of the cells or slightly greater. We have considered Krogh cylindrical model of the capillary surrounded by tissue. The blood cell was assumed as particle suspended in plasma flowing in axisymmetric Stoke’s flow. Flow in the narrow gap between the particle and the gap have been studied. The gap between the cell and the capillary wall is small so that the lubrication theory is applicable. Both prolate and oblate spheroids shape of the red cell have been considered. Results for total drag have been brought out for different shapes of parameters involved.
