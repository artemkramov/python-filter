Physico-chemical characteristics of ground water of Manachanallur Block Trichy, Tamilnadu, India
Trichy has located in centre of Tamilnadu (India). Manachanallur is one of the main taulk which is called as “green valley of trichy”. It also has a historical importance and is blessed with fertile lands, having and various types of rice mills. It has an area of 36383.85 hectare of land in which 35236 hectare is under cultivation. Manachanallur taulk is located in northern part of the trichy district. Its border populated upto perambalur district. The people in the 40 villagers use kollidam river water and the ground water for drinking. Lot of work has been done and published already on the ground water quality of many village in other taulk of trichy district. But in the manachanallur taulk, there is a need to undertake the study to assess the drinking water quality. Hence water samples of ten villages were subjected to physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), Calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+), Chloride (Cl-), Nitrate (NO3-), Sulphate (SO4 2-) were analyzed (APHA, 1998) The results were compared with standards prescribed by ISI 10500-91/ICMR/WHO and suitable suggestion were made.. The correlation coefficients were calculated for water quality assessment.
