Chemically Reacting on MHD Oscillatory Slip Flow in a Planer Channel with Varying Temperature and Concentration
In this paper, unsteady MHD mixed convictive oscillatory flow of an electrically conducting optically thin fluid flow through a planer channel filled with saturated porous medium. The effect of buoyancy, heat source, thermal radiation and chemical reaction are taken into account embedded with slip boundary condition, varying temperature and concentration. The closed-form analytical solutions are obtained for the momentum, energy and concentration equations. The influences of the various parameters entering into the problem in the velocity, temperature and concentration fields are discussed with the help of graphs. The effect of skin friction, the rate of heat and mass transfer coefficients at the walls are discussed qualitatively.
