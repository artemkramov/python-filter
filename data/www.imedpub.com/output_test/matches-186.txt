A kinetic study of the adsorption of reactive Yellow 21 dye on flamboyant shells activated carbon
Activated carbon prepared from flamboyant shells was used for the removal of reactive yellow 21 dye from aqueous solutions. The kinetics of reactive yellow 21 dye adsorption on flamboyant shells activated carbon adsorbent is best described by the pseudo second order kinetics model with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.999. The rate constant of pseudo-second order kinetics increases with increase in temperature; whereas, the amount of adsorbed reactive yellow 21 dye on the adsorbent decreases with increase in temperature. Adsorption of reactive yellow 21 dye on flamboyant shells activated carbon adsorbent is found to be strongly dependent on the pH of the medium.
