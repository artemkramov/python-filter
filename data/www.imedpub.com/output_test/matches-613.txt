Predictive deconvolution in seismic data processing in Atala prospect of rivers State, Nigeria
Predictive deconvolution is the use of information from the earlier part of a seismic trace to predict and deconvolve the latter part of that trace. In processing procedure, the information recorded in the field is put into a form that most greatly facilitates geological interpretation. Predictive deconvolution is an attempt to attenuate multiples which involve the surface or near-surface reflectors. The prediction filter was designed which yields the predictable component (the multiples) of a seismic trace, while the remaining unpredictable part, the error series is essentially the reflection series. The shaping filter so designed is used to convert the recording signature to its minimum-phase equipment and apply it to the input record. The output has been processed by predictive deconvolution using operation length of 160ms and prediction lags. When the data from the field are fully processed, geological interpretation could easily be harnessed. The various stages, procedure and figures are shown clearly. The theory of predictive deconvolution of processing was exhaustively discussed. The unprocessed data got from the field operations are fed into automatic computer whose programme is written in line with the theory.
