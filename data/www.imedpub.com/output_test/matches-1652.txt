Analysis of ground water potential in Chandragiri Mandal, Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh
Ground water prospects of any area depend on its geological structure, geomorphic features and their hydrological characters. Identification and mapping of these elements is thus imperative for ground water exploration and optimal management of this precious resource. In the present paper ground water potentiality in Chandragiri mandal, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh has been evaluated by analyzing the hydro geomorphic parameters using Remote sensing Techniques. Satellite image and Topographical map have been used to prepare the required thematic maps like geology, lineaments, geomorphology, surface water bodies and drainage. These maps have been integrated in GIS environment to demarcate the hydro geomorphic units. Nine hydro geomorphic units viz. Flood plain, Moderately Weathered pedi plain, Shallow Weathered Pedi plain, Residual hill, Denudation hill, Structural hill, Inselberg, Pediment and Bajada have been derived from the integrated map. Ground water potentiality has been qualitatively assessed by analyzing the derived hydro geomorphic units after considering the field information.
