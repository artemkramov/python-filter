Structure, surface morphology and thermal study of strontium tartrate crystals grown in silica gel by single diffusion method
In this analysis, crystals were grown by adopting simple gel technique by single diffusion method. Effect of various parameters like gel pH, gel aging, gel density and concentration of reactants on the growth of these crystals was studied. Crystals having different morphologies and habits were obtained. Whitish, pale yellow semi-transparent crystals of strontium tartrate were obtained. Maximum size of grown crystals is 6mm x 6mm x 3mm. The grown crystals were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDAX, thermogravimetry and UV Visible spectroscopy. The crystal structure is monoclinic and crystalline perfection of the crystals is extremely good. SEM image showed plate like morphology and EDAX study revealed that grown crystals are of strontium tartrate, indeed. UV-Visible spectrum indicates that strontium tartrate crystals have non linear optical property as it has sufficient transmission in the entire UV region. The absorption coefficient is high at lower wavelength and the wide transparency from 270 nm suggested their suitability for second and third harmonic generations.
