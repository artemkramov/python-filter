Investigation of irrigation influence with domestic wastewater on quantity and quality features in different mint's species
In this experiment, we have used the soil as a biological filter that can to absorb pollution in the domestic wastewater. In this experiment, we had 15 lysimeters, that were planted Mentha spicata in 1 to 5 lysimeters were irrigated by domestic wastewater and primary drainage water were accumulated. The 6 to 9 lysimeters were planted Mentha piperita were irrigated by primary drainage water and then, were accumulated secondary drainage water and we have irrigation 10, 11 and 12 lysimeters by secondary drainage water that were planted Mentha aquatica. In order to compare plants characteristics, in 13 (Mentha spicata), 14 (Mentha piperita) and 15 lysimeters (Mentha aquatica) were irrigated by agronomical water. The essential oil yield of mint 14% increased under irrigation by secondary drainage water into irrigation by agronomical water. The findings may give applicable advice to commercial farmers and medicinal and aromatic plants researches for management and concern on water strategy and estimate of irrigation carefully for increase of quantity and quality yields in medicinal and aromatic plants farming.
