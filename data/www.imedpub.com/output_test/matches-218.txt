Voltage Source Converters as the building block of HVDC and FACTS Technology in Power Transmission System: A Simulation based Approach
Recent advancement of technology in power electronics ,the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based technology has been selected as the basis for several recent power system projects due to its controllability, compact modular design, ease of system interface and low environmental impact. This paper describes the rationale for selection of VSC technology and the latest technical developments utilized in recent power transmission system. Voltage Source Converters (VSC) have for the first time been used for HVDC transmission in a real network. Experience from the design and commissioning of the transmission shows that the technology has now reached the stage where it is possible to build high voltage converters utilising Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). Operation and system tests have proved that the properties that have been discussed for many years regarding VSCs for HVDC are a reality now. They include independent control of active and reactive power, operation against isolated ac networks with no generation of their own, very limited need of filters and no need of transformers for the conversion process. The development of semiconductors and control equipment is presently very rapid and it is evident that this technology will play an important role in the future expansion of electric transmission and distribution system .This paper mainly focus light on- VSC’S based HVDC and FACTS technology.
