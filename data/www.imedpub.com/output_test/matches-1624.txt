Low temperature dyeing of PET / PTT blend fibers
Polyester and Poly trimethylene terephthalate chips were melt blended in the ratio of 90/10, 80/20 and 70/30 and melt spun to make filaments. The compatibility of the fibre blends was proved by Differential Scanning Calorimetry study. The blend fibre showed decrease in glass transition temperature as well as melting point and also crystallization temperature. The melt blended fibres dyed with high energy disperse dyes gave the optimum dyeing depth for at 1100C as against 1300C required for normal polyester fibres. Also the depth of dyeing in case of melt blend fibre was significantly higher as compared to that observed in case of dyeing of virgin Polyester. The wash and light fastness of the dyed samples was also found to be same as observed in case of dyed virgin Polyester fibre. There was only marginal decrease in tensile strength of melt blend fibres.
