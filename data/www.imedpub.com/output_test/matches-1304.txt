Incidence of renal stone disease among urinary tract infection patients and antimicrobials susceptibility
To determine incidence of renal stone disease among urinary tract infection patients and antimicrobials susceptibility this cross sectional study was undertaken at Ibb city of Yemen between December 2008 and May 2009. The total study population was 70 patients that chosen from free different hospitals (Alqadree hospital, Alnasr hospital, and Clinical laboratory). Both male and female patients with age range of &lt;20 to &gt;40 years, with renal stones, urinary tract infection and antimicrobial susceptibility were included. The data was obtained and analyzed by filling a specially designed proforma for each patient. In all 70 patients infection was present in 78.6% of cases. The age group that suffered most from infection renal stones disease among the 20-40 year-old group with 67.1% (47/70), distributed between men and women as following: 59.6% (28/47) for women and 40.4% (19/47 for men. The commonest organisms isolated according to culture report were E. Coli (71%), with 66.7%,(16/24) for women and 33.3% (8/24) for men, Klebsiella (12%), with 66.7% (2/3) for women ,and 33.3% (1/3) for men, Proteus (7%), with 66.7% (2/3) for men, 33.3% (1/3) for women. The frequency of renal stones disease in patients with urinary tract infection was 32.7 %. however, Ofloxacin (OF) was more sensitivity for (24/41) E.coli with a ratio 58.5% , (8/9) Klebsiella with a ratio 88.9% and (5/8) Proteus with a ratio 62.5% , Ciprofloxacin (CL) for (21/41) E.coli with a ratio 51.2% ,(5/9) Klebsiella with a ratio 55.6% and (5/8) Proteus with a ratio 62.5% ,and Gentamycin (J) for (19/41) E.coli with a ratio 46.3% ,(8/9) Klebsiella with a ratio 88.9% and (5/8) Proteus with a a ratio 62.5%. With strong back ground we can colculsion that renal stone disease makes an important group among urinary stone diseases. Urinary tract infection with certain bacteria plays an important role in the synthesis of renal stones. A high incidence can be prevented by adopting a variety of simple conservative measures
