A review on induced breeding of cat fishes, murrels and climbing perches in India
The breeding period of cat fishes, climbing perches and murrels in India is variable. Environmental factors play an important role in regulating reproduction in fishes. Choosing a successful synthetic hormone involves the selection of effective hormone formulations, proper duration of hormonal treatment and timing of the hormone administration. Induced breeding of cat fishes, climbing perches and murrels of India by various hormonal analogues is reviewed based on published literature. Synthetic hormones viz., ovaprim and ovatide are successfully being tested (in place of pituitary extract) for the induced breeding of fishes. Since, newly formulated inducing agents are also being tested for the induced breeding performance by various researchers in different parts of the country, under different climatic conditions, with varying degree of success. These synthetic hormones have following advantages over pituitary extract: ready to use in liquid form, consistent potency, stored at room temperature, stable with long shelf life and single dose requirement. Although natural spawning is the preferred method for breeding cultivated fresh water fishes, induced breeding is necessary to control timing and synchrony of egg production
