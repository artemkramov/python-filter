Some biochemical compounds of bryozoan, Zoobotryon verticillatum (Delle Chiaje, 1828) in the inner harbor of Visakhapatnam, east coast of India
Zoobotryon verticillatum (Phylum: Ectoprocta) is a marine animal, which exist as colonies. It is widely distributed in inner harbor of Visakhapatnam. Z. verticillatum found attached to wood and ropes of sunken fishing vessels at fishing harbor as fouler. Preliminary screening of biochemical compounds in Z. verticillatum indicated that it is a rich source of alkaloids and steroids. The alkaloids detected were Quinoline, Purins and Quinazoline and their quantities (mg/500 mg sample) estimated were 73.090 mg, 155.235 mg and 271.675 mg respectively. The steroids detected were Norethindrone and Prednisone and their quantity (mg/25 mg sample) estimated was 12.0065 mg and 12.9935 mg respectively. These compounds are biologically active as cytotoxic, anti-malarial, neurotropic, androgenic, gonadotropin inhibiting and pregnancy inhibiting properties.
