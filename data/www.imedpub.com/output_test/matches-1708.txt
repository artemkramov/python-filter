Biochemical composition of some selected seaweeds from Tuticorin coast
Seaweeds have been used as an important source of food because of their biochemical composition. In the present study, biochemical composition of edible seaweeds was investigated. Totally six seaweed samples (Enteromorpha compressa, E. intestinalis, Dictyota dichotoma, Turbinaria ornata, Gracilaria corticata and Hypnea musciformis) were analyzed. Quantitative analysis of protein content ranged from 9.47% and 14.68%. High protein content was found in the brown seaweed T. ornata and low protein content in the red seaweed G. verrucosa. Carbohydrate content of seaweeds ranged from 10.63% and 28.58%. The maximum carbohydrate content was recorded in the green seaweed Enteromorpha intestinalis and the brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma recorded the minimum value. The Lipid content of seaweeds varied from 3.15% to 5.30%. The maximum lipid content was recorded in green seaweed E. intestinalis and the red seaweed G. verrucosa recorded the minimum content
