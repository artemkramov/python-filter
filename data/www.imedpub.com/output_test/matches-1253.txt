DC conductivity of PbxSe1-xthin films prepared by thermal evaporation technique
In the present work, including study the effect of different concentration (X=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 ) , substrate temperature(303 and 348) K, and annealed to 348 0K . on the electrical properties for PbXSe1-X thin films, which prepared by thermal evaporation. D.C. conductivity showed increase with increasing concentration ,substrate temperature and annealing temperature and all films have two activation energy Hall measurements showed that the films at x=0.1and x=0.2 was n- type, but at x=0.3 and x=0.4 was p- type with carrier's concentration and mobility increase with increasing of substrate temperature and annealing temperature
