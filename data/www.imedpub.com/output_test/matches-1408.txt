Trend of organ-wise change in selected antioxidant enzyme activity in spotted scat from Cochin backwaters
Reactive oxygen species generation and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant profiling have been emerged as an important area of research due to its correlation with environmental stress where the organism inhabit and as a way to recover from ROS induced damages. Here an attempt was done to investigate the antioxidant enzymes like Catalase, Superoxide dismutase, Glutathione peroxidase activity in four organs viz., gills, liver, kidney, muscle in a species of fish, Spotted scat (Scatophagus argus) collected from a traditional brackish water farm in Kochi to understand the organ-wise alterations in these enzyme activity in fish. The results showed a similar trend of organwise variation in all the antioxidant enzyme activity like liver &gt; gills &gt; Kidney &gt; muscle in the fish species selected
