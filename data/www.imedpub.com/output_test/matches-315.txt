Study of hygrothermal transfer through porous clay tubes application to the cooling of water volume in the sahelian zone
After conducting studies on hygrothermal transfer in porous terracotta tube, we present here a study of the cooling of a water reserve in hot, dry climate. This water is contained in a parallelipedic enclosure, through which porous tubes placed in staggered rows are subjected to a forced convection of hot dry air. The aspect ratio (F = D / L ≈ 0.32) allows to neglect the longitudinal variations of the thermo physical properties of air. The theoretical model is based on the Darcy equation for the fluid through the porous material, the Laplace equation relating to pressure and the equation of heat in polar coordinates. An improved computer code that takes into account the variation of heat transfer coefficients at each time step allows better simulations. The code of calculation enables to identify areas of intrinsic permeability favorable for continuous low evaporation without drying of the water film and this computer code enables to describe the hygrothermal transfer
