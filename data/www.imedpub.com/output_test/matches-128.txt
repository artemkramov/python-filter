Quartz REEF and mineral exploration study using W-4 2D ERI system at Varasanadu, Theni District, Tamilnadu
Quartz reef is used for several applications in indusial purpose. 2D Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) investigation is suitable method to determine the geotechnical problems and it is used for the high quality of quartz reef bed thickness estimation. 2D Electrical Resistivity Imaging with Wenner array was conducted within the Quartz reef area in Varasanadu, Theni district, Tamilnadu. The geology of the study area contains red soil, quartz reef and weathered gneissic rock which signify good target for 2D electrical resistivity imaging techniques. The interpretation of the resistivity data along the profile shows the model resistivity pseudosection in quartz reef area. The highly resistivity zone of pseudosection with range of resistivity is 103 – 407 ohm.m at a depth of 4.06 m to 5.96m indicating the hard quartz reef rock.
