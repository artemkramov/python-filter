Nutrient changes and biodynamics of epigeic earthworms Eisenia fetida (Savigny) and Eudrilus eugeniae (Kinberg) during recycling of bagasse fly ash
Bioconversion of industrial wastes into nutrient rich product using earthworms is of double interest: on the one hand, a waste is converted into organic fertilizer for soil application and on the other, it controls accumulation of harmful waste that is a consequence of growing industrialization. This study reports the feasibility of utilization of vermicomposting technology for nutrient recovery from sugar industrial waste bagasse fly ash (BFA) mixed with cow dung (CD) in laboratory scale experiment. Two different earthworm species Eisenia fetida and Eudrilus eugeniae were utilized for bioconversion of BFA as well as the quality of the end product. Four different treatments including one control were used for the experiment. Results reveal that significant reduction in total organic carbon (TOC), C:N ratio but increase in total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) after 60 days of processing in T2 and T3 treatments for both species of worms.. E. fetida and E. eugeniae showed maximum biomass production, maximum cocoon numbers and hatchlings production in 1:1 ratio of BFA+CD (T2) mixture as compared to other treatments and control (BFA alone). Based on investigations it is concluded that vermicomposting using earthworms E. fetida and E. eugeniae could be an alternative technology for the management of BFA if it is amended in 1:1 ratio with cow dung
