Fabrication and characterization of a direct absorption solar dryer
Based on preliminary investigations under controlled conditions of drying experiments, a direct absorption solar dryer was fabricated from local materials and tested under actual environmental conditions of Obinugwu, a popular community in Orlu, Imo State, Nigeria. This paper describes the fabrication techniques and presents the results of diurnal temperature variation between the hot box and the surrounding. The dryer was fabricated with a hot box of area 0.39 m2. A glass roof was designed to rest onto the hot box which also served as the drying chamber. The average of the ambient temperatures recorded was 330C, whereas 590C was the average temperature of the drying chamber. Temperature measurement was carried out within nine consecutive days.
