Assessment of trace heavy metal contaminations of some selected vegetables irrigated with water from River Benue within Makurdi Metropolis, Benue State Nigeria
Levels of cadmium, copper, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc were determined in irrigation water, vegetable and fruit and soils of Makurdi irrigated farmland along river Benue, Nigeria. The water used for irrigation had the following concentration 0.00013±0.0004, 0.0022±0.0010, 0.0024±0.009 μg/g For Cu, Mn and Zn respectively while Cd, Ni and Pb was not detected in irrigation water. The concentrations of all the heavy metals studied were detected in all the soil and plant samples. Heavy metal concentrations varied among different vegetable and fruit studied. Among the vegetable and fruit examined, Zn and Mn have the highest concentrations, but their concentrations in all the vegetable and fruit samples studied were below the recommended safe limits of heavy metals by WHO, FAO, EU Standards
