The Proximate and Ultimate analyses of some selected freshwater biomasses: Eichornia natans (Water Hyacinth), Pistia stratiotes (Water Lettuce), and Nymphaea lotus (Water Lily) were undertaken with the aim of presenting the analytical results and ascertaining the biomass composition for use as biofuel. Results showed that the amount of fat in the leaf of water hyacinth, water lettuce and water lily was 8.7%, 8.15% and 7.2% while the stem of water hyacinth, water lettuce and water lily recorded 3.65%, 2.2% and 7.25% respectively. The amount of reducing sugar in the leaf of water hyacinth was 0.31 g/l and 0.29 g/l was found in the stem. Similarly, 0.25 g/l was found in water lettuce leaf and 0.27 g/l in its stem, 0.38 g/l in water lily leaf and 0.35 g/l in its stem. The amount of nitrogen in the biomass varied between 2.35% and 7.76% and the amount of sulphur was between 0.27% and 3.24% while the amount of carbon was between 45.25% and 65.04%. The calorific value of the leaf of water hyacinth, water lettuce and water lily was 17.64 MJ/kg, 18.57 MJ/kg and 19.53 MJ/kg respectively, while the stem of water hyacinth, water lettuce and water lily recorded 20.53 MJ/kg, 24.93 MJ/kg and 20.98 MJ/kg respectively. The study concludes that aquatic weeds can be utilized as viable feedstock for the production of biofuel.
