Thermoelectric system to generate electricity from waste heat of the flue gases
In any industry, the three top operating expenses are often found to be energy (both electrical and thermal), labour and materials. If one were to relate to the manageability of the cost or potential cost savings in each of the above components, energy would invariably emerge as a top ranker, and thus energy management function constitutes a strategic area for cost reduction. This contribution analyzes approaches that led to discovery of thermoelectricity. Thermoelectric restrictions imposed on the application areas of thermoelectric generators and, accordingly, the ensuing rational lines of their practical applications are considered. The possibilities of thermoelectric systems’ contribution to “green” technologies, in particular, to waste heat recovery from industry exhausting flue gases. Attention is focused on the selection of the thermoelectric system and the experimental model representing the system. Finally there is theoretical model calculation for generation of emfs(voltage) and validation comparing the experimental results of the emfs(voltage).
