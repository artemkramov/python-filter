Assessment of Groundwater Quality with special reference to fluoride in South Eastern part of Anantapur District, Andhra Pradesh
The fluoride concentration in underground water was determined in Southwestern part of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh (India) where it is the only source of drinking water. Various other water quality parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved salts, total hardness, total alkalinity as well as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride and sulfate concentrations were also measured. The analytical results indicated considerable variations among the analyzed samples with respect to their chemical composition. Majority of the samples do not comply with Indian as well as WHO standards for most of the water quality parameters measured. The fluoride concentration in the underground water of these villages varied from 0.5 mg/l and 5.5 mg/l causing dental and skeletal fluorosis. Overall water quality was found unsatisfactory for drinking purposes without any prior treatment.
