Determination of Physico-Chemical Parameters of Deoli Bhorus Dam water
In the present study, water samples were collected from two different locations of Deoli Bhorus Dam of Chalisgaon Tahsil Dist. Jalgaon in Maharashtra State, India for physico-chemical analysis. The laboratory test of the collected water samples were performed for analysis of various parameters such as pH, Temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Alkalinity, Acidity, Total Hardness (TH), Chloride and Phosphorus. The methods employed for the analysis as per standard methods recommended by APHA, WHO, ICMR. The obtained values are compared with the standard limits. The results of this study reveal that the physico-chemical parameters are within the maximum permissible limit of WHO with some slight variations in some parameters. Hence, water is safe and suitable for domestic, irrigation and drinking purposes.
