Experimental and theoretical evaluations-excess ultrasonic speeds in binary liquid mixture at different temperatures
The Ultrasonic speeds (U) of binary liquid mixture of 1,4-dioxane with 1-pentanol including those of pure liquids, over the entire composition range expressed by mole fraction x1 of 1,4 dioxane was measured at temperatures (298.15, 303.15, 308.15, 313.15, and 318.15) K. From the experimental data, calculated the various theoretical evaluations viz., Nomoto, Impedance, Van dael and Vangeel, Rao’s specific velocity and Junjie’s for the binary mixture. Theoretical values are compared with the experimental values and molecular interaction parameter (α) is evaluated for understanding the different kinds of association, molecular packing and various types of intermolecular interactions. Using experimental ultrasonic speeds, excess ultrasonic speeds (UE) are reported. A good agreement has been found between experimental and theoretical values of ultrasonic speeds. The relative applicability of these theories to the present system has been checked and discussed. The results are explained in terms of molecular interactions occurring in the binary liquid mixture and the negative excess ultrasonic speeds conforms existence of strong specific interactions in the mixture
