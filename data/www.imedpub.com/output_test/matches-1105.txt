Chemical characterization of incinerated gold (Swarna Bhasma)
Swarna Bhasma (incinerated gold) is used as a therapeutic medicine from long ago in the Ayurvedic medicinal practice. The numbers of procedures for its preparation were mentioned in the texts of Rasashastra. Bhasma is prepared from the different metals and minerals by its systemic incineration with specific herbals and other relevant media. Along with this, classical texts of Ayurveda Rasashastra (Indian Alchemy) mentioned its therapeutic efficacy depends on its particle size. Lesser the particle size increases its efficacy. However, it is typical mechanical process but its finished product contains different chemical elements. As it is used as a therapeutic agent, its chemical characterization is need of hour. Swarna Bhasma was analyzed by adopting modern scientific tools like XRD, EDS and ICP-OES to determine its major and minor contents. It was revealed that Swarna Bhasma (incinerated gold) contains 52.33 % Au in elemental form. Its particle size ranges in between 1-10 μm
