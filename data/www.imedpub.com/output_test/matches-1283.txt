Evaluation of biochemical composition and in vitro antioxidant properties of selected seaweeds from Kanyakumari coast, Tamil Nadu, India
To analyze the antioxidant profile and biochemical components of six Indian seaweeds (Ulva fasciata, Chaetomorpha antennina, Spiridia hypnoides, Amphyroa anceps, Sargassum wightii, Chnoospora maxima) from Kanyakumari coast. Among these six seaweeds the carbohydrate content was high in Chnoospora maxima (55.86±0.75%) and least in Amphyroa anceps (25.76±0.88%) and protein was high in Sargassum wightii (16.34±0.04%) and low in Amphyroa anceps (7.86±0.01%). The lipid content was recorded high in Chnoospora maxima (0.54±.005%) and less in Ulva fasciata (0.21±.003%). In the methanol extract of seaweeds, the phenolic content was recorded high in Chnoospora maxima (19.351±0.323 mg GAE/g) and less in Amphyroa anceps (4.456±0.212 mg GAE /g) and the maximum antioxidant activity was observed in Chnoospora maxima (12.756±0.187mg AAE/g) and least in Amphyroa anceps (3.985±0.121 mg AAE /g). In FRAP, maximum inhibition was observed in Chnoospora maxima (20.045±0.321%) and less in Amphyroa anceps (6.097±0.312%). The highest inhibition of hydrogen peroxide radical activity was shown in Sargassum wightii (21.652±2.172%) and low in Amphyroa anceps (6.231±0.356%).The DPPH scavenging capacity was highly recorded in Sargassum wightii (11.512±0.076%) least in Chaetomorpha antennina (1.562±0.054%). The Deoxyribose scavenging activity was maximum present in Sargassum wightii (9.541±0.032%) and less in Chaetomorpha antennina (1.332±0.07%).
