Evaluation of Anti-bacterial Activity of Indigenous Medicinal plants Species of India
In the present study 10 medicinally important plant species were screened for their phytochemicals by using 4 different solvents, aqueous, Acetone, Petroleum Ether and Chloroform and subjected to anti-bacterial activity. All the extracts showed high to moderate amounts of anti-microbial activity against selected gram positive and gram negative bacterial species. The aqueous and organic solvents extracts from 10 selected plants showed highest zones of inhibition on gram positive bacteria than gram negative species. The gram bacterial species B.cereus, S.aureus and S.epidermidis showed highest sensitivity towards these four extracts. The gram negative bacterium P. aeruginosa showed highest sensitivity to these extracts and Shigella flexeneri showed highest category of resistance to these extracts. The Woodfordia fruticosa stem aqueous, acetone and extracts showed the best inhibition zones against these gram negative bacterial species. The S.saponaria, fruit pericarpic extracts showed the best zones of inhibition against all the bacterial species tested. All the A.squamosa seeds cotyledon extracts showed unsatisfactory zones of inhibition when compared to the other plants extracts against these gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
