Effects of deposition time on the electrical and composition of chemically deposited Mgx-1NsS thin films
Magnesium nickel sulphide (MgNiS) thin films were prepared on glass slides by chemical bath deposition technique (CBD). The electrical, composition and optical studies were done. These analyses were obtained using a four point probe technique, energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and a Janway 6405 UV-VIS spectrophotometer respectively. The effects of variation in the deposition time on the electrical, composition and optical properties of the grown films were discovered. The electrical analysis shows that the grown films are P-type semiconductors. This is because their electrical conductivities are greater than the intrinsic conductivities. The compositional study shows that as the deposition time increases, the Mg2+ decreases. The optical analysis indicates that the grown films can be used as antireflection films, solar control coating and absorber layer films. These were discovered from their optical properties
