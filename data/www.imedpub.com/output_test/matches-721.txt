Effect of sulphuric acid concentration on the inhibiting action of 0.001M adenine solution during the corrosion of AISI 304L
In this research the effect of sulphuric acid concentration on the inhibiting action of 0.001M adenine solution during the corrosion of AISI 304L has been investigated. The research was achieved by using 0.001M concentration of adenine solution and varied sulphuric acid concentration of 0.1M, 0.3M. 0.5M, 0.7M, 0.9M and 1.0M; readings were obtained every 240hours (10 days) for a period of 1200hours (50 days). Weight loss, corrosion penetration rate, inhibition efficiency and degree of surface coverage were calculated. Results obtained revealed that adenine is an effective and safe corrosion inhibitor for AISI 304L in sulphuric acid solutions within the concentration range of the acid investigated. The inhibition mechanism involves the adsorption of protonated adenine molecules onto the 304L surface. Analysis of the results showed that the inhibition efficiency and surface coverage decreased with increasing sulphuric acid concentration, causing an increase in corrosion penetration rate and weight loss as the concentration of the sulphuric acid was increased. The corrosion penetration rate, however, decreased with increased immersion time. Also, the inhibition efficiency and surface coverage decreased with increasing immersion time.
