Effect of vermicompost-bred earthworms on fish growth
Organic waste recycling is an efficient and environmentally friendly technology to convert wastes into value added products. Vermicomposting uses earthworms to turn organic wastes into very quality compost. Major nutrient status of vermicompost of agro waste processed by species of earthworm namely, Eudriluseugeniae. There is very little information on the use of earthworm meal in poultry diets. Care must be taken when growing earthworms for use in animal feeds. Heavy metals and other pollutants are taken up by the worms and can be passed on to the birds consuming the earthworms ([1]). In the present investigation, live earthworms bred from vermicompost were used as feed. Carbohydrate, protein was increased in earthworm fed fish when compared to fish with control diet. The lipid content was lower in in earthworm fed fish as compared to fish with control diet. The study concludes that earthworm fed fish has good nutritional impact as compared to fish with control diet. This study suggested that earthworm superior feed for fish than artificial or control feed.
