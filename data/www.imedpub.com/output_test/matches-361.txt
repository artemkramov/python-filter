Study of Ground Water Quality In Industrial Zone Of Visakhapatnam.
This paper presents quality of water samples from bore wells as well as open wells in and around the industrial zone of Visakhapatnam in order to find out the magnitude of health problems in industrial areas. The natural quality of ground water tends to be degraded by human activities. Ten groundwater samples collected from the study area were measured and mentioned. The study revealed that the water was slightly alkaline (PH: 6.5 – 8.5), moderately hard (TH: 64 – 292), and TDS values ranged from 380 – 1600 mg/l). The study was reported some other important parameters which exceeded the permissible limit and it is unsuitable for drinking purposes.
