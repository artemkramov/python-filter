Different Possible Ways for Saving Energy in the Cement Production
In terms of absolute consumption, the cement industry occupies a front position in the ranks of energy consumed industries. The total energy costs (thermal and electrical) make up about 30 to 40 percent of the total production costs of cement. This is why efficient energy utilization has always been a matter of priority in the cement industry. Cement manufactures requires very high temperatures to initiate the reaction and phase changes necessary to form the complex mineral compounds that give cement its unique properties. Pyro-processing in large rotary kiln is the operational step that provides the energy and environmental conditions necessary for the reaction and phase change. This operation dominates the energy consumption and environmental impacts associated with the manufacture of the cement. Improvement of energy efficiency reduces the emission of carbon dioxide from fuel and electricity use and may also reduce the costs of producing the cement. Process improvement may be attained by energy management, applying more energy efficient process equipment and by replacing old installations by new ones or shifting to complete new types of cement production processes, cement kiln optimization process, performing the research and development necessary to prepare and burning the alternative fuels in cement kiln and to develop new cement manufactures
