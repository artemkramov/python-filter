Amino acid profile of purple sea urchin shell (Salmacis Virgulata, L. Agassiz and Desor 1846)
This study evaluated the presence of essential and non essential amino acids present in the purple sea urchin shell Salmacis virgulata. Sea urchins were collected and powdered for the amino acid analysis by HPLC. An HPLC method was used to analyse the amino acids in dried purple sea urchin. The resulting amino acids were chromatographed on an RP C18 column with UV detection at 254 nm. The mobile phase was a mixture of 0.14 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 0.05% triethylamine and 6:4 (v/v) acetonitrile-water, at a flow rate of 0.9 ml min-
