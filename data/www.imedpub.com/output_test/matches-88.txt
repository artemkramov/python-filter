Studies on Zooplankton Diversity in Dimbhe Reservoir, Maharashtra, India
A study was carried out to examine the diversity and density of zooplankton in Dimbhe (Pune, Maharashtra) reservoir, India. Various water quality parameters viz. water temperature, pH, DO which influence the diversity and production of zooplankton were studied. Sampling was carried out during two seasons viz. winter (2008) and summer (2009). The study on physico-chemical parameters has shown a variation in different seasons in the selected reservoir. The maximum zooplankton density recorded in Dimbhe was during summer season with 5123 no./100 litre, while in winter it was 1314 no./100 litre. A total of seven species of zooplankton were recorded each during both the seasons with Copepoda being most commonly observed order and Cypris sp the most dominant. The variations in density and diversity in the reservoir can be related to variation in their physico-chemical parameters which in turn may be due to geographical position and various anthropogenic activities. The present study aims at providing a preliminary knowledge on the productivity and diversity of zooplanktons which can be utilized during the formulation of management measures to improve the productivity of the reservoir
