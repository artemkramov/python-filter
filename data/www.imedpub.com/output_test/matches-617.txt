Assessment of Physico-Chemical Quality of Groundwater in rural area nearby Sagar city, MP, India
Ground water is one of the major resources of the drinking water in Sagar city (M.P.). In the present study groundwater quality of the selected 02 Villages nearby Sagar city were taken for under investigations by forty groundwater samples collected from entire villages and assessed for their suitability for human consumption. Physico-chemical parameters were carried out during different months of the pre monsoon, monsoon and post monsoon seasons in june2007– July 2010. The statistical analysis of the collected samples yielded the range of the variation, mean, standard deviation and co-efficient of variation. The multiple regression analysis and regression equation indicated that the degraded water quality of Gambhira and Baheria is caused by anthropogenic activities and inappropriate rural water management action plan.
