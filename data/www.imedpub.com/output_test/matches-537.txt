Antibacterial activity of water, ethanol and methanol extracts of Ocimum gratissimum, Vernonia amygdalina and Aframomum melegueta
The antibacterial efficiency of cold water and hot water, ethanol and methanol extracts of Ocimum gratissimum, Vernonia amygdalina and Aframomum melegueta on Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae were evaluated by disc diffusion technique. The cold water extract of V. amygdalina and A. melegueta slightly inhibited the growth of S. typhi and E. coli with inhibition zone diameter of 15 mm and 12 mm respectively. The hot water extract of O. gratissimum, V. amygdalina and A. melegueta moderately inhibited the growth of S. typhi and E. coli with inhibition zone diameter of 15 mm to 20 mm. While the ethanolic and methanolic extract of O. gratissimum, V. amygdalina and A. melegueta profoundly inhibited the growth of S. typhi and E. coli with inhibition zone diameter between 12 mm to 23 mm. The growths of K. pneumoniae were not inhibited by all the extracts of O. gratissimum, V. amygdalina and A. melegueta. This revealed that O. gratissimum, V. amygdalina and A. melegueta have antimicrobial activity on E. coli and S. typhi and probably could be used to control infections associated with these organisms.
