Nutrient status evaluation of Nagzari dam water of Maharashtra
Nagzari dam (Lat. 190-36’- 0” N and Long. 780- 16’- 0” E) in Kinwat tahsil , Nanded district is one of the latest additions to the string of dam dotting the Satmala and Nirmal Ghats zone in Maharashtra. Nutrient status is widely regarded as a reliable index of dam fertility. Scientific understanding of the production potential of dam is a prerequisite for utilizing these water bodies for drinking, irrigation, domestic and aquaculture etc. Not much information is available on nutrient status of such ecosystems in our nation. The present study represents an attempt to know the nutrient status of the Nagzari dam and its systematic evaluation. The parameters like Nitrite-Nitrogen and Phosphate and their data gathered from two stations of the dam during July 2005 to June 2007. The values of Nitrite-Nitrogen and Phosphate were found to be in the range of 0.80 to 7.5, 0.90 to 7.8 and 0.19 to 0.87, 0.20 to 0.90 mg/L respectively.
