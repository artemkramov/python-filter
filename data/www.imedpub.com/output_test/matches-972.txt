An efficient and ecofriendly RuO2-MoO3 solid heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of benzimidazole from aldehydes
An ecofriendly and recyclable solid RuO2-MoO3 mixed oxide was used as catalyst for the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives. This method provides several advantages such as short reaction times, high yields, simple work-up procedure, environmental friendliness and catalyst was successfully reused for four cycles without significant loss of activity
