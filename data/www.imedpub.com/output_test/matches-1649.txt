Characterization of reservoir rock types in the upper rudeis reservoir rocks, Gulf of Suez, Egypt
Identifying reservoir rock types and their most significant vertical and horizontal heterogeneities is an essential component of reservoir characterization process. A reservoir classification and rock typing study were carried out on the Upper Rudeis reservoir rocks (Asl and Hawara formations), of a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate lithology in the Gulf of Suez, Egypt, by integrating both large-scale geologic elements and small-scale rock petrology with the physical rock properties for the studied reservoir. The work-flow in this study integrates multiple data evaluation techniques and multiple data scales using a core-based rock typing approach supplemented by well logs that is designed to capture rock properties characteristic of Upper Rudeis reservoir rocks. The results reduce uncertainty and allow a better definition of the vertical variability distribution of petrophysically constrained rock types within the sequence stratigraphy constrained correlation and deliver cyclostratigraphic data of depositional facies interpretation.
