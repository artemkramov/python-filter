Studies on natural fiber particle reinforced composite material for conservation of natural resources
The invention is an effort to utilize the advantages offered by renewable resources for the development of composite materials based on polymer and particles of natural fibers for Conservation of natural resources. Natural fibers have the advantage that they are renewable resources and have bio degradable properties. In this invention, powder material of natural fibers Sisal (Agave sisalana), Banana (Musa sepientum) &amp; Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) , Sisal and banana (hybrid) , Roselle and banana (hybrid) and Roselle and sisal (hybrid) are fabricated with polymer using molding method. This invention focuses on establishment of superior mechanical and material properties of the hybrid composite. The disclosure includes the process to make the composite for bone implant and also the variety of products in automotive, furniture, upholstery, house hold goods and computer goods
