In this paper, we introduce the notions of an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy positive implicative hyper BCK-ideal of types-1,2,3,â€¦,8. Then we present some theorems which characterize the above notions according to the intervalvalued level subsets. Also we obtain certain relationships among these notions, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (strong, weak) hyper BCK-ideals and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy positive implicative hyper BCK-ideals of types-1,2,3,..,8 and obtain some related results.
