The influence of industrial effluents from Dakace industrial area on the heavy metal profile of River Galma, Zaria, Nigeria
This study examined the influence of discharges from Dakace industrial area on the heavy metal profile of River Galma, Zaria, Nigeria. Water samples were collected from both upstream and downstream along the main stream drainage channel, traversing past Dakace industrial area between May 2011 and May 2012. The samples were digested according to standard methods and analyzed for Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) and Nickel using Schemadzu atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model 6800, Japan). The range of concentrations (mg/l) of these metals was: Pb, (0.025-4.12), Zn (0.018-1.12), Cu (0.02-0.56) and Ni (0.00-2.55). Significant (P &lt; 0.05) seasonal variation in metal levels was observed, but the spatial variation was not statistically significant (ANOVA, P &gt; 0.05), indicating that effluent discharged from Dakace industrial area had no significant influence on the heavy metal profile of the river. Lead and nickel contents of the water were several folds above the maximum contaminant Levels established by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ). Copper and nickel concentrations recorded were found to be above the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council limits for irrigation water. Continuous use of water from the study area for drinking or irrigation therefore poses serious toxicological risk. The implications of these findings for public health are fully discussed
