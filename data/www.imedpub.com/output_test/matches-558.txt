Comparing Energy in Different Buildings using two Insulators
This paper describes how to measure conductivity of two new insulators. Mat is made up of Agave plans which are now produced in Iran; gunny made up of plant fibers which is producing in Iran both can be used in walls of buildings to reduce energy loss in cold season. In this work the thermal conductivity for mat is to be 0.06949 J/s.m°c and also from temperature gradient curve it was found that the temperature changes uniformly with thickness of the mat and also the thermal conductivity for gunny is to be 0.080 J/s.m°c and also from temperature gradient curve it was found, the temperature changes uniformly with thickness of the gunny. Finally the difference of the energy gain in the brick buildings with &amp; without the mat was estimated to be 1.9656×10³ kcal in the cold season in Tehran for 150 days. Ultimately it was estimated energy gain in the brick buildings with &amp; without the gunny to be 2.393×105 kcal in the cold season in Tehran for 150 days. The measured thermal insulation of mat and gunny proved to be more desirable comparing with other insulators.
