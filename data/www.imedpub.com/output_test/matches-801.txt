Optical Waveguides on Polymer Substrates for chemical sensing applications
We demonstrate the inscription of optical waveguides on a polymer substrate using an excimer laser. The fabricated waveguides are imaged using phase contrast microscopy. The suitability of PMMA for fluorescence sensing applications, the Experimental procedures and characterization techniques used in our work is presented.
