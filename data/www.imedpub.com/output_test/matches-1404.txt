Distribution of eleven priority phenolic compounds in soils from mixed landuse and assessment of health hazard for human population
This study was carried out to determine eleven priority phenolic compounds in soils from rural-urban area in northern Uttar Pradesh, India. Further, a probabilistic approach was used to determine the human and ecological health effects based on the concentrations of phenolic compounds in soils. The task of determination involved the use of ultrasonication and manual shaking extraction technique and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with diode array detector (DAD) for qantification. The Concentration of total eleven phenolic compounds ranged between BDL-7.08 mg kg-1 with a mean value of 1.92 mg kg-1 (±0.35 mg kg-1). The average daily dose for lifetime exposure through soil for adults and children was 3.0x10-6 mg kg-1 d-1 and 1.1x10-5 mg kg-1 d-1, respectively. A non-cancer health hazard in terms of the hazard index (HI) due to phenolic compounds through soil ingestion was 2.6x10-4 and 9.7x10-4 for human adults and children, respectively. The observed concentration levels of phenolic compounds in soils were lower than stipulated guideline values for the protection of environmental and human health. Health hazard was much lower than acceptable safe risk level (HI≤1). Therefore, it can conclude that concentrations of eleven priority phenolic compounds in soil and their hazardous effects to human population were low
