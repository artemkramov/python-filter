Effect of calcination on morphology and optical properties of AlO-ZnO nanocomposites
In the present investigation, main emphasis has been given to synthesize AlO-ZnO nanocomposites by a Sol-Gel method based on polymeric network of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The idea behind sol-gel synthesis is to “dissolve” the compound in a liquid in order to bring it back as a solid in a controlled manner. In this method mixture solvent of 50:50 ethanol-water was used to dissolve aluminium nitrate, zinc nitrate and PVA. The mixture was heated to 80° C to form homogeneous gel. The hard gel was calcined at a temperature of 600° C for 4 hour and 8 hour and finally converted into nanocomposites. The prepared nanocomposites have been characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-VIS. and Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The size of nanocomposites heated at 600° C for 4 hour and 8 hour using Scherrer formula comes out to be 36.4 nm and 15.20 nm respectively. Infrared spectroscopy is also used to determine presence of various functional groups. SEM revealed the polycrystalline structure of the nanocomposite
