In vitro regeneration of an endangered medicinally important plant: Lasiosiphon eriocephalus Decne
In-vitro multiplication of Lasiosiphon eriocephalus an endangered medicinally important species of Family Thymaleaceae is reported in the present work. Apical buds, Lateral buds, Leaves and Internodes were cultured on Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium supplemented with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg l -1 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP), 2, 4 – dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and Kinetin. Meristematic tissues (Apical and lateral buds) responded by showing multiple shooting in all the three concentration of BAP, Explants inoculated in 1 mg l -1 BAP responded in 7 days (swelling was observed) and shoot initiation was noticed within 15days of inoculation. Callusing was observed in the leaf explants cultured on media supplemented with 2, 4-D. Rooting was induced in the in vitro regenerated shoots by sub-culturing them to M.S. medium fortified with 0.5 mg l -1 IAA. Rooted cultures were then subjected to primary hardening in pro trays containing vermiculite and coco peat. Finally the plants were transferred to green house for secondary hardening.
