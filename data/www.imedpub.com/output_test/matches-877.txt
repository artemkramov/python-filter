Extractive Spectrophotometric Determination of Trace Amounts of Cadmium(II) In Medicinal Leaves Environmental and Biological Samples by using 3-methylthiophene-2-carbaxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-MTAT)
A First reagent 3-mthylthiophene-2-carbaxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-MTAT) is proposed as a sensitive and selective analytical reagent for extractive spectrophotometric determination of trace amount of cadmium (II). 3-MTAT reacts with cadmium(II) to give a light yellow coloured complex in a sodium acetate and acetic acid buffer solution of pH=6.0. The colour reactions have been investigated in detail. This is easily extracted into isoamylalchol with 1:2 compositions having maximum absorbanceat wavelength 360 nm. The molar absorptivity and sandell’s sensitivity are found to be 4.0 x 104 l mol-I cm-I, and 0.0029 μg/cm-2 respectively. The interfering of various diverse ions have also been studied. The method has been successfully applied for the extractive spectrophotometric determination of trace amount of cd (II) in several standard reference materials as well as medicinal leaves, environmental leafy vegetables, biological, water and soil samples.
