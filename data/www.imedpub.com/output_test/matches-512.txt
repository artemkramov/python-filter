Effect of dip time on the structural, electrical and morphological properties of antimony sulphide thin films
Amorphous Sb2S3 thin films were deposited on glass substrates by solution growth technique. The structural property was analyzed by XRD, the elemental composition was estimated from EDX analysis while the surface morphology of the film was examined by SEM. The effect of dip time on each of these properties was studied. Amorphous nature of the film was confirmed from XRD and SEM analysis. The thickness of the Sb2S3 thin film was estimated from surface profile analysis and found to increase as deposition time increases. The resistance of the films at different dip time was obtained from V/I values from surface profile analysis. The film was seen to have very high resistance in the range of 1.23 x 109Ω to 1.29 x 109Ω while the sheet resistance was in the range of 0.645 x 103Ω-m to 1.23 x 103Ω-m depending on the dip time.
