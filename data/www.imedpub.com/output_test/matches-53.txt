Interpretation of ground magnetic data of Ilesa, Southwestern Nigeria for potential mineral targets
A geophysical ground magnetic survey was carried out in eastern part of Ilesa town located in the southwestern part of Nigeria. Total field magnetic data was recorded using a proton precision geometric magnetometer along fifteen traverses. This research focused on delineation of subsurface geological structures that are suitable for mineral potential. The field data collected was qualitatively and quantitatively interpreted. The residual magnetic values were in the range of about 80nT to -330nT. The magnetic source depth was estimated using Peters half slope method which gave a maximum depth to basement of about 160m. The lateral extent of interpreted lithologies was estimated using the analytical signal. The results generated were used to delineate geological structures and to target areas with mineral potential
