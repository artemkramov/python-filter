Thermal focal length of Nd: YLF laser rod crystal at 797nm and 792nm diode-end pump
A theoretical studied are carried out to study the thermal focal length in a-cut Nd: YLF laser rod crystal at 20W Diode- end-pumped. Different thermal lensing effects for p and s polarizations have been theoretically analyzed .Our results show that the values for thermal focal length are positive for s polarization and negative values for p polarization for end pump laser wavelength 797nm and 792 nm respectively
