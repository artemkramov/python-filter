AVR Microcontroller Based Data Acquisition System for Laboratory Experiments
Data acquisition and control system based on AVR microcontroller (Atmega16), for laboratory experiments is presented. This makes use of the built in ADC of the microcontroller and thus the resolution is 10 bits i.e. one part in 1024. In a typical setup the measuring system, under program control keeps on monitoring the voltage or current analogue inputs and makes the digital equivalent available on the selected ports. The controlling program on a PC read this input at pre-decided time intervals. The controlling program reads these values and process accordingly. Microcontroller programs are also developed and tested successfully. The data acquisition system was successfully used to monitor voltage and current during the experiment of growth of fractals. This data acquisition system is also used for other application such as to monitor changes in optical density of chemical solutions to demonstrate its application in Nephlometry. This data acquisition system can be easily be implemented on any real time measuring system in experimentation.
