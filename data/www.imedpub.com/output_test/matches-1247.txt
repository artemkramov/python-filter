Effects of chemical reaction and radiation absorption on mixed convective flow in a circular annulus at constant heat and mass flux
In this paper, the effects of chemical reaction, radiation absorption on mixed convective heat and mass transfer, flow of a viscous fluid through a porous medium in a cylindrical region between concentric circular cylinders r = a and r = b in the presence of heat generating sources are dealt appropriately. Hear, the outer cylinder r = b is maintained at a constant heat and mass flux. The relation between the temperature is explained in the equation of state and constant heat source in the field region. The governing non-linear partial differential equations can be transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations are them solved by using Gauss-Seidal Iteration method. The effect of variation of governing parameters on the flow heat and mass transfer characteristics are discussed through the graphs and tables
