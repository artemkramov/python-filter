Study of Average Coordination Number Using Topological Concept in Ge-In-Se Glasses
The growing interest in the investigation of the properties of chalcogenide glasses stems from the actual and potential technological applications of these materials in solid state devices. Moreover, several of these glasses are easily formed by melt-quenching over a large range of compositions making them suitable model systems for the investigation of the composition dependence of their properties. In this paper, we reported the results from measurement of the glass composition Ge22InxSe78-x (x=2, 4, 6, 8, 10), the dependence of glass transition temperature Tg, atomic percentage of Se and atomic density with variation in average coordination number (Z) on the basis of topological considerations.
