Elemental analysis of gel grown Ca-Cd tartrate
Mixed crystals of Calcium-Cadmium Tartrate have been grown by gel technique. The optimum conditions were established by varying various parameters such as pH of gel solution, gel concentrations, gel setting time, concentration of reactants etc. Crystals having different morphologies and habits were obtained. Transparent, pyramidal shaped like diamonds crystals of Calcium Cadmium tartrate were obtained. Some of them were faint yellowish, milky white, due to fast growth rate attached crystals are obtained; faces are well developed and polished. The crystals grown were characterized by X-ray powder diffractometry and Energy Dispersive Analysis by X-rays (EDAX). The results of these observations are described and discussed.
