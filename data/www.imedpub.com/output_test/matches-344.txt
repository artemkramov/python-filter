Uranium distribution study in the drinking water samples of SW Punjab, India
In the present investigations, the Laser Fluorimetery technique has been used for the microanalysis of uranium concentration in 141 ground water samples collected from different sources like the hand pumps, tube-wells of various depths from wide range of locations from the Mansa, Bathinda and Faridkot districts of SW-Punjab, India. The major objective of the present investigation was to investigate the uranium concentration levels of groundwater being used for the drinking purposes and thus determination of its health effects to the local population of this region. It has been observed from the data analysis that average value of uranium content in ground water samples collected from all the three districts was higher than WHO &amp; USEPA recommended safe limit of 30 μg/l and even it also exceeds the threshold of 60 μg/l recommended by AERB, DAE, India. The maximum values of uranium concentration in drinking water samples has been found to be 645.2, 323.9 &amp; 375.8 μg/l in the Mansa, Bathinda &amp; Faridkot districts respectively, which exceeds the national and international recommended safe limits.
