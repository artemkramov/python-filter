Thermo acoustical study of tetrahydrofuran with ethanol using ultrasonic technique at 323K
The density, ultrasonic velocity and viscosity at the temperature 323K and at 3MHz frequency have been measured in the binary system of Tetrahydrofuran (THF) with the aliphatic alcohol Ethanol. When two or more liquids are mixed, there occur some changes in physical and thermodynamic properties because of change in free volume, change in energy and change in molecular orientations. Thermodynamic and acoustical parameters like adiabatic compressibility, intermolecular free length, specific acoustical impedance, Gibbs energy, relaxation time, free volume and internal pressure are of considerable interest in understanding the inter-molecular interactions in binary liquid mixtures. Using measured values of ultrasonic velocity, density and viscosity, following evaluated different acoustical interaction parameters such as adiabatic compressibility (βa), intermolecular free length (Lf), specific acoustical impedance (Za), relaxation time (τ), Gibbs energy (ΔG), free volume (Vf) and internal pressure (πi) can be used to study the Physico-chemical behavior and molecular interactions in pure liquids, liquid mixtures and the solutions. From these acoustical parameters, the nature and the strength of molecular interactions in the binary system of Tetrahydrofuran (THF) + Ethanol are discussed.
