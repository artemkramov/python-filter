Oscillatory MHD free convective flow between two vertical walls in a rotating system
The effects of radiation on oscillatory MHD free convective flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting fluid confined between vertical walls in a rotating system have been studied. The flow is due to the periodically oscillating motion of one of the walls. The exact solutions of the governing equations have been obtained by using the Laplace transform technique. The variations of velocity, fluid temperature and shear stress at the moving wall are presented graphically. The velocity components increase with an increase in magnetic parameter. The primary velocity decreases whereas the secondary velocity increases with an increase in radiation parameter. There is an enhancement in fluid temperature as time progresses. The absolute value of the shear stress at the moving wall due to the primary flow increases whereas the absolute value of the shear stress at the moving wall due to the secondary flow decreases with an increase in either rotation parameter or radiation parameter. The rate of heat transfer at the moving wall increases with an increase in radiation parameter
