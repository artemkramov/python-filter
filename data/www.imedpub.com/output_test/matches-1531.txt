A randomised controlled trial to study the efficacy of mobilization with movement combined with low level laser therapy in lateral epicondylitis
To investigate the combined effectiveness of mobilization with movement (MWM) and low level laser therapy (LLLT) in treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Both MWM and LLLT are commonly used treatment for lateral epicondylitis. No study has investigated the effectiveness of MWM combined with LLLT. Thirty subjects with lateral epicondylitiswere randomized to either experimental group (n=15), which received MWM combined with low level laser therapy or control group (n=15), which received only low level laser therapy. Treatment was given for 5 days per week for total three weeks. Outcome measures that are PRTEE scoring and grip strength were assessed at day 1 and after every 5 days for 3 weeks for both the groups. Group A which received movement with mobilization with laser therapy showed highly significant improvement in grip strength, functional status and reduction of pain at 2nd &amp; 4th week of treatment with statistically significance of p&lt; 0.001. Our study showed that both the groups were effective in reducing pain and improving grip strength and functional status.However, it can be concluded that movement with mobilization combined with low level laser therapy provide better results for lateral epicondylitis
