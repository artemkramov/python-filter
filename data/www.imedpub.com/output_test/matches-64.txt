Molecular interactions in binary mixtures of acrylates with heptane-2-ol
Viscosities and ultrasonic velocities of binary mixtures of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate with heptane-2-ol have been measured at 303.15 and 313.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. Deviations in viscosity and deviations in isentropic compressibility were calculated and have been fitted to Redlich-Kister equation. Ultrasonic velocities calculated theoretically to predict using Nomoto, Van Dael, free length theory and collision factor theory. Experimental viscosities were correlated by semi-empirical equations such as Heric-Brewer and McAllister three and four body model equations. Jouyban-Acree model used to correlate viscosity and ultrasonic velocity
