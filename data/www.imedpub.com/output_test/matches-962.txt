Adiabatic compressibility, apparent molal volume, apparent molal compressibility and solvation number of 2,3Ã¢ÂÂDihydroquinazolinÃ¢ÂÂ4(1H)Ã¢ÂÂone derivatives in 70% DMF-Water
Density and ultrasonic velocity measurements are carried out for substituted -2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones in 70% DMF-Water at T= 303K. The experimental values are used to calculate adiabatic compressibility, apparent molal volume, apparent molal compressibility and solvation number. These acoustical parameters obtained are used to explain the interaction taking place in the solutions.
