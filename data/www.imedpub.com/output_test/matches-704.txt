Solvent extraction separation of Rhodium(III) with 4-(4-ethoxybenzylidene amino)-5-methyl-4H-1, 2, 4-triazole-3-thiol (EBIMTT) as an extractant
Investigation was made on the extraction and spectrophotometric determination of microgram level of Rhodium (III) with a newly synthesized extractant 4-(4-ethoxybenzylideneamino)-5- methyl-4H-1, 2, 4-triazole-3-thiol (EBIMTT) in chloroform from sodium malonate medium. The optimum conditions have been determined by making a critical study of acid, metal ion and extractant concentration, period of equilibration, pH, various diluents and stripping agents. The effect of diverse ions on the quantitative extraction of Rhodium(III) has also been studied. The method is simple, rapid, reproducible, and free from interference of almost all metal ions tested. The proposed method is applicable for the analysis of binary mixtures, synthetic mixtures, alloys and real samples. The molar absorptivity and Sandell’s sensitivity of Rhodium (III)-EBIMTT complex are (1.6×104 L mol-1 cm-1) and (0.054μg cm-2), respectively which indicates the applicability of the method.
