Acid activated tea bag waste as an adsorbent for the removal of chromium ions from tannery waste water
This research work focuses on the utilization of tea bag waste of some commercial teas as a precursor for the production of an adsorbent for the removal of chromium ions from tannery waste effluent. The tea bag waste was chemically activated with 1.0 M sulfuric acid to produce the adsorbent. Nearly 100% removal of chromiumfrom real tannery waste water is achieved with the activated tea bag waste adsorbents.
