The measurements of boron concentration rate in water using curcumin method and SSNTDs Techniques
A technical method has been used two sets of experimental works in the measurements of Boron concentrations in water. The first measurement is by using curcumin method and the second is the passive method by using the solid state nuclear track detectors, CR39. Tap water in the governorate, has a very low Boron concentration 0.355 ppm atAl-Bedeah river, Al-Jzeera AlOula, did show a Boron level as high as 7.405 ppm at east governorate, while the waters have Boron level ranging between 7.785mg/l and 0.638 mg/l in curcumin method .A conclusion has been made, that Basra governorate tap water is safe as far as Boron concentration is concerned , while the rivers waters should be avoided. The high concentration tells us that pollutant in this part of city is larger than the other parts. Samples of water were collected during April 2011, from all locations in Basra City
