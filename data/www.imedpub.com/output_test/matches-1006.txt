Nanoparticles accelerated in-vitro biodegradation of LDPE: A review
Plastics are characteristically inert and resistant to microbial attack and therefore they remain in the nature without any deformation for long time. Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) being an inevitable necessity has spanned high levels of environmental pollution due to its poor waste disposal and thus requires better ways for its degradation management. The conventional methods have shown inadequate degradation with environmental constraints which have been overcome by microbial and enzymatic process of biodegradation. Landfilling, inceration are ways for the disposal of plastic but have number of drawbacks such as lowers water absorption of soil thus reduces the soil fertility. Therefore degradation with the microbes especially by making microbial consortium will be a good choice. Nanoparticles have entered the scientific world with varied potential applications. Studies with nanoparticles have shown their unique ability in enhancement of polymer degradation. Nanoparticles influence the growth profiles of LDPE degrading microorganisms to augment the biodegradation rate, a major problem faced. The review primarily focuses on researches related to the degradation aspect where nanoparticles have acted as enhancers of biodegradation
