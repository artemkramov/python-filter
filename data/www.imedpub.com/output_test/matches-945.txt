Performance analysis of domestic refrigerator with forced and natural convection
The system is not present in use due to arrangement of its various parts which are using additionally in it. In present, domestic refrigerators work on vapor compression cycle. In this cycle the heat is rejected through condenser or heat exchanger. In this way the rejection of heat occurs as a natural convection, due to this, refrigerating effect will obtain. Our modification in this system is that, if we perform through an arrangement of heat exchanger and exhaust fan the flow rate of heat should increase. Thus, in this way at same energy input the refrigerating effect may improve. Our future plan is to modify the domestic refrigerator that it could work on both natural convection and forced convection. In this way we can compare the Coefficient of performance for both processes and may do comparative study about both systems at different-different conditions
