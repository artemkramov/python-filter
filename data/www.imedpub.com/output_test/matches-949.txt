Energy Integration of Sugar Production Plant Using Pinch Analysis: A Case Study of Savanah Sugar Company Yola, Nigeria
Energy integration is a subdivision of a wider field of process integration, which is an efficient approach that allows industries to increase their profitability through reduction in energy, water and raw materials consumption, reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste generation. Energy pinch analysis principally matches cold and hot process streams with a network of exchangers so that demands for externally supplied utilities are minimized. In this study energy integration of Savannah Sugar Company was carried out using pinch technology with HENSAD software. The minimum approach temperature of 7°C was used and the pinch point was found to be 114.5°C. The hot utility requirements for the company before (traditional) and after pinch analysis approach were found to be 3258 kW and 2120 kW respectively, while the cold utility requirements were 102393 kW and 45500 kW, respectively. Hence the technology is an efficient tool that can help to safe cost and other resources when applied to process plants.
