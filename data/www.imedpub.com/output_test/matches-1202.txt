Comparative effect of biofilm and ESBL production on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolates from Clarias gariepinus
Sixty six bacteria isolates from three organs (skin, gut and gills) of Clarias gariepinus, African catfish, were tested for the production of biofilm and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) using conventional methods. Positive isolates for the production of either or both factors were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility test. All bacteria producing either or both factors were multidrug resistant (MDR). The fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) were highly potent against all isolates at 100%, closely followed by gentamycin at 85.1%. However, resistance were recorded at high rates to augmentin, cefixime, cefuroxime and ceftazidime at 100%, 89.6%, 85.1% and 74.6% respectively. A test of statistical significance on the effect of either or both factors in the number of drugs resisted using t-test at p&lt;.05 reveal that there is no significant difference between the effects of ESBL, biofilm and ESBL-biofilm production among the isolates. However, a higher mean was observed among biofilm producers compared to ESBL and ESBL-biofilm.
