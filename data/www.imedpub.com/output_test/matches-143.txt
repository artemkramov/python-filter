Influence of pressure on the mechanical properties and grain refinement of die cast aluminum A1350 alloy
An experimental study on the “the influence of pressure on the mechanical properties and grain refinement of die cast aluminum A1350 alloy” was carried out and subsequent analysis made. The results obtained from the microstructure analyses carried out on the A1350 alloy cast samples show that structural changes occurred as different morphologies of grains size and numbers were observed under the different applied pressures in the castings as some appeared granular, lamella, coarse e.tc. also the mechanical properties like the tensile, impact strength and hardness all showed variations under different pressures in the castings as the hardness increased with applied pressure from 77 to 86 HRN and tensile, yield strengths and elongation of the cast samples varied as maximum values were observed with applied pressures of 1400kg/cm2 and the impact strength increased with applied pressures from 3.98 to 4.44 joules. Microstructure refining caused by more number of grains and finer grain sizes was observed in the micrograph in the sample at applied pressure of 1400kg/cm2 and porosity was not found due to microstructure refining as compared with those obtained at 0 kg/cm2 and 700kg/cm2 These results illustrate how the influence of pressure on the grain refinement and mechanical properties can be used to improve the qualities of die cast products.
