Optimization of media composition for keratinase production on feather by Acremonium strictum RKS1
Five-level-five factors concept was utilized for the optimization for keratinase production by Acremonium strictum RKS1. Experiments were performed as a function Duration, pH, Amount of substrate, Nitrogen source and Carbon source. Optimization of these five parameters for the maximum production of keratinase was studied. Statistically designed experiment using response surface methodology was used to get more information about the significant effect and the interaction between the five parameters. 2n full factorial central composite design was employed for the experimental design and analysis of result. The optimum process condition for maximum enzyme production as follows: Duration 12.8 day, 10 pH, Amount of substrate 199mg, Nitrogen source 3.5% and Carbon source 3%. The maximum keratin production was achieved (92.7%) at the optimum process conditions.
