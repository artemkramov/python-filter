Hall coefficient, mobility and carrier concentration as a function of composition and thickness of Zn-Te thin films
The Hall Effect studies on Zn-Te thin films of different composition and thicknesses have been made at room temperature for different magnetic fields between 3 to 9.5 K Gauss at different electric field currents between 1 to 50 μA. Hall voltages was measured for varying magnetic and electric fields. The Hall coefficient (RH) and mobility (μH) are independent of magnetic and electric fields, however they changes with film thickness and composition of the film. The films showed P-type behavior irrespective of thickness and composition. The variation of carrier concentration (nH) depends on thickness and composition of Zn-Te films, observations show the carrier concentration decreases with increase of thickness while that increases with increase of at. wt.% of Zn in the film. Thin films of Zn-Te compound of varying composition and thicknesses have been formed on glass substrates employing three temperature method
