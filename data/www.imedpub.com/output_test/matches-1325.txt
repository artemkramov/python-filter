Classification and compaction characteristics of lateritic soils of Warri, Delta state, Nigeria
The research investigated the Classification and Compaction characteristics of lateritic soils of Warri, the economic nerve center of Delta State, Nigeria. Soil samples were collected from eight locations and subjected to Geotechnical test programmes; Sieve analysis, Consistency tests, Compaction and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) Tests. Classification tests (sieve analysis and consistency tests) reveal the Lateritic soils are of A6, A3 and dominantly A2- 4 type characteristics based on the American Association Of State Highway and transport Officials (AASHTO) Classification Scheme.CBR values indicate the soils are suitable sub-grade materials (having CBR; 10.10-26.10%) but would require appropriate stabilization to be competent sub-base and base courses for road construction.
