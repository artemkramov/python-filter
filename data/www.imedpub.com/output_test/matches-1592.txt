Study on co-relation between concentration of distillery effluent and seed germination of gram nut and kidney bean
Distillery effluent discharged as wastewater contains various toxic chemicals that can contaminate water &amp; soil and may affect the common crops by using this water for agriculture irrigation. A laboratory work was undertaken to assess the co-relation between treated distillery effluent concentration and seed germination by using different concentration of distillery effluent like 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, &amp;100%.
