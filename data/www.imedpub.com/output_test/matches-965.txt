Determination of total phenolic content and total antioxidant activity in locally consumed food stuffs in Moodbidri, Karnataka, India
In the present study, a total of forty locally consumed food stuffs (vegetables, fruits, seeds, berries, cereals, herbs and tree materials) in Moodbidri, Karnataka, India were examined for their total phenolic content and total antioxidant activity. Total phenolic content is determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The total antioxidant capacity was evaluated by phosphomolybdenum method. Among screened plant materials, remarkable high phenolic content was found in curry leaves (18.40mg GAE/g) which contributed its high antioxidant activity (48.94 mg AAE/g). This study reveals that some of the common food stuffs could be utilized as a source of natural antioxidants
