Thermodynamics of binary liquid mixtures of acrylates with dodecane-1-ol
Thermodynamic data involving density, viscosity and ultrasonic velocity of binary liquid mixture containing methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate with dodecane-1-ol at 303.15 K and at atmospheric pressure have been measured; these experimental values were correlated by Jouyban-Acree model. These basic parameters further used to evaluate excess molar volume, deviation in viscosity and deviation in isentropic compressibility of binary systems and these values were fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. The mixture viscosities were correlated by Grunberg-Nissan, Tamura-Kurata, McAllister three and four body model equations. The calculated excess molar volumes, deviation in isentropic compressibility were found to be positive and deviations in viscosity were found to be negative for all binary liquid mixtures
