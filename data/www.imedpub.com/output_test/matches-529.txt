Optical and structural properties of amorphous antimony sulphide thin films: Effect of dip time
Amorphous thin films of antimony sulphide were successfully deposited on glass substrates by chemical bath deposition technique. The structural and morphological characterizations were performed on the films by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively while the elemental composition of the films was obtained from energy dispersive analysis x-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy. Optical characterization of the films was done using an AVASPEC-2048 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200-900nm. The effect of dip time on the optical, structural, elemental composition and morphological properties of the films was examined. It was observed that the direct band gap of the film decreased from 1.80eV to 1.50eV as dip time increases from 12hrs to 36hrs respectively.
