Recent studies on the certain specific parameters of Kala Talao (Lake) Kalyan, Maharashtra, India
Kala Talao (lake) in Kalyan, Maharashtra, India, commonly referred as ‘Shenale’ is presently managed &amp; maintained by KDMC and is utilized by the public for various recreational activities and cultural events including rituals etc. Several NGO’s are monitoring and spreading general awareness regarding conservation &amp; management of existing water bodies by holding rallies, events, programs etc. and with this regard the "JalPooja" was very recently organized by the Hon. Jagatguru Shankaracharya. Hydrological parameters &amp; its variations are useful in finding the sources of pollution &amp; its effective management. Further these parameters also govern the distribution of animals/ organisms and hence essential in understanding the correlation with environment. The current investigations are carried out to assess and examine the varied parameters, status &amp; quality of water and also recent comprehensive published data on the Physico-Chemical Parameters of Kala Talao is not available. The samples of Kala Talao water are regularly collected at intervals of 3-4 months from 2 sites since last 2-3 academic years. Certain parameters are processed immediately at the site and/or within 4-6 hrs, while the rest of parameters were assessed at research center/ laboratories. The results indicate that the sample waters are fairly contaminated and require immediate restoration with effective treatment &amp; management
