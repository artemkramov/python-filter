The indiscriminate use of sex enhancing products among Ghanaians: Prevalence, and potential risk
Unregistered sex enhancing drugs have flooded most cities in Ghana and are highly patronized by the populace.This study aims atestablishing the use of these drugs in a socially and commercially active community in Kumasi, Ghana.Questionnaireson the subject were administered to 224 individuals and data obtained analyzed using SPSS 17.Results revealed that73 (61 %) males and 48 (46 %) females were using these drugs; 72 (59.5 %) being above 36 years. Premature ejaculation in males (53 %) and decreased libido in females (47 %) were the main reasons for their use. Sixty three (86%) malesand 44 (91%) femalesclaimed effectiveness. Forty one (56 %) males and 33 (69 %) females reported headache after use. All participants who were diabetic 16 (7.1 %) and hypertensive diabetic 9 (4 %), and 83.3 % of those who are hypertensive 12 (5.4 %)were users.Prior to their use of sex enhancing drugs 50 (41 %) were in a psychological state of fear of sexual failure during intercourse and 30 (25 %) have negative feeling for their partners. The drugs enhance sex and improve the quality of sex life for most users but the side effect of headache may be an indication that it raises blood pressure. This could lead to cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular accidents, stroke and sudden deaths.Confidence during sexual intercourse, enjoyment of sex, closeness to partner(s), and happiness after sex improves tremendously but safety with the use of these drugs is a public health concern.
