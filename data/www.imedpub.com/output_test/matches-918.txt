Assessment and statistical study of physico-chemical properties of water quality in some local water treatment plants in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The work aimed to assess the quality of drinking water in some of local commercial water treatment plants in Jeddah city, five samples were taken from different water plants subjected to physical, chemical and biological analysis. The parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC),total dissolved solids (TDS),salinity (Sal.), total hardness (TH),calcium (Ca),magnesium(Mg), sodium(Na), potassium (K), iron (Fe), chloride (Cl), fluoride (F), nitrate (NO3), bicarbonate (HCO3), sulphate (SO4) and microbial examinations were done for all samples. These results were compared with the maximum level of the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Specification and Standardization organization (SASO) and Gulf Countries Standards for drinking water (GCS). The results showed a compliance with the water quality standards regarding the physical, chemical and biological characteristics. Statistical tools such as average, standard deviation and the correlation coefficient (r), were also calculated for these water quality characteristicsThe work aimed to assess the quality of drinking water in some of local commercial water treatment plants in Jeddah city, five samples were taken from different water plants subjected to physical, chemical and biological analysis.
