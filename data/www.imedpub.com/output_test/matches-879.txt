Molecular Interactions of Acrylonitrile and Methylmethacrylate in Methanol, Cyclohexane &amp; P-dioxane
The Velocity of ultrasonic waves (10 MHz) for different compositions of mixtures of methanol, Cyclohexane and p-dioxane with acrylonitrile and methylmethacrylate has been measured in the temperature range 10 - 400 C. The excess compressibility βa E and excess molar volume VE parameters have been discussed in the light of inter-molecular AB interactions and resulting disorder in these mixtures. It is observed that excess parameters βa E and VE can be used for classification of all types of molecular interactions in binary liquid mixtures.
