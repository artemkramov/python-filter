Importants and Studies of Surface Topography of Lead Iodide Signle Crystals Grown by Gel Technique
The single crystals of Lead Iodide grown by simple, inexpensive and accurate technique i.e.gel technique. Gel is formed by mixing Acetic Acid and Sodium Metasilicate. Potassium Iodide is incorporated into the solution of Acetic Acid, Sodium Meatasilicate is then added upto constant pH. After setting the gel, supernatant is added over the set gel. The optimum conditions have been obtained to grow the single crystals of Lead Iodide. Then these crystals were characterized by XRD and Surface Topography. Lattice constants are well matching with ASTM data for the Lead Iodide. Surface Topography useful for the understanding of mechanism of development and growth of habit faces, in particular and crystals in general.
