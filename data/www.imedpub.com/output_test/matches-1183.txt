The impact of lead and nickel in some hematological parameters in house sparrow (Passer domesticus)
The aim of this study was evaluation of environmental pollution with heavy metals such as Lead and Nickel on the living organisms in industrial areas, using the blood of House sparrow (Passer domesticus) as a bio-indicator of pollution by metals. For this purpose, a blood collection was performed on 32 house sparrows (Passer domesticus) males and females, which were captured in Mitrovica town (situated close to smelter “Trepqa”, down closed in 2000 year), Drenas town (near the Ferronickel smelter, pollution area) and in rural area (Ujmir village, not contaminated area). We have analyzed: number of RBC and WBC, hematocrit value (Hct) and hemoglobin count (Hgb) in blood of house sparrow. The results obtained indicate a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes in significant degree (p &lt;0.01) in the blood of sparrows caught in Drenas and Mitrovica compared with sparrows caught in Ujmir (control). Higher of hematocrit value (p &lt;0.001) of sparrows caught in Ujmir compared with the sparrow population caught in Mitrovica and Drenas, while no significant differences in the amount of hemoglobin between the analyzed groups. However, the results are correlative; they “call” for further studies in the sparrow population and in the laboratory.
