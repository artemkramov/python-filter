Isolation &amp; production of cellulase enzyme from bacteria isolated from agricultural fields in district Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, India
Cellulose is one of the most abundant polymer found in nature (EC 3.2.1.4). It occurs in almost pure form in cotton fiber and in combination with other materials, such as lignin and hemicelluloses, in wood, plant leaves and stalks, etc. It has already been used in processing of coffee, in textile industry and in laundry detergents. Cellulose is a long chain polymer, made up of repeating units of glucose, a simple sugar, joined together with β-1,4 glycosidic linkages. Cellulases cause hydrolysis of the individual cellulose fibers to break it into smaller sugars units &amp; finally producing glucose molecules. The soil samples were obtained (10gm) from Hardoi district, Uttar Pradesh, India. Bacterial colonies were grown over CMC-Agar medium[1]. Maximal cellulase production was obtained after 48 h of incubation at 45 °C in medium containing 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as substrate. The optimum pH for the enzyme was found to be ranging between 6.5 and 7.5 at which it was found to be most stable. Bacteriological studies indicated Bacillus subtilis to be the most frequent cellulolytic bacteria to be found in the agricultural fields. . The purpose of the current investigation was to screen thermophilic Bacillus species isolated from soil in order to study its suitability with regard to waste treatment in agricultural fields (bioremediation).
