Removal of Basic Dyes from Aqueous Solutions by Sugar Can Stalks
The adsorption removal of a basic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and crystal violet (CV) on sugar can stalks were investigated using batch adsorption technique. Different variables such as solution pH, dye concentration and temperature were examined to optimize the methods. Removal of both dyes was observed to be most effective at higher pH. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models were applied to the equilibrium data. The results showed that Langmuir equation fits better than the Freundlich equation. It was observed that the sugar can stalks adsorbent showed higher adsorption capacity for CV (18.7 mg/g) than MB (9.8 mg/g). The studies show that sugar can stalks, a waste inexpensive material, can be an alternative to other expensive adsorbents used for dye removal in wastewater treatment.
