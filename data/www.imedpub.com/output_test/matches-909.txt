Length-weight relationship, relative condition factor and growth of Oratosquilla anomala (Tweedie, 1935) (Crustacea: Stomatopoda) off Visakhapatnam, east coast of India
The length-weight relationship of males and females of Oratosquilla anomala collected at Visakhapatnam were W = 0.003368992 L1.7336 and W = 0.002779713 L1.7801 respectively. A single length-weight relationship is given for both the sexes as W = 0.002932243 L 1.7801. Analysis of covariance conducted to test the difference between the regression slopes of males and females of O. anomala showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). Relative condition factor for males and females was given for this study. The age and growth were estimated by applying ELEFAN 1 method; it confirmed the longevity of the stomatopod to be 124 months. The growth rate was high during the first year and then it declines during subsequent years. The Von Bertalanffy’s growth parameters were L¥ = 124.95, K = 1.0, t0 = 0.11and Ø = 4.1935/yr respectively
