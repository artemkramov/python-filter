Phenolic and antioxidant potential of sunflower meal
Sunflower oil cake/meal was subjected to conventional liquid solvent extraction using various solvents such as Methanol, Ethanol, Ethanol:Water 1:1, Methanol:Water 1:1, Acetone, Isopropanol and Ethyl acetate. The optimum solvent extraction conditions of phenols were 180 min. using 7 different solvent systems, at a solvent to sample ratio 5:1 (v/w). Solvent extracts were tested for their antioxidant activity by the DPPH radical scavenging method and by determination of peroxide value on Soybean oil and Sunflower oil. The Ethanol extract exhibited the highest antiradical activity, and no correlation was found between antiradical activity and phenol content. Moreover, the Ethanol extract appeared to be a stronger antioxidant than BHT by the Rancimat method performed on sunflower oil and soybean oil. LCMS analysis of the extracts showed that the predominant phenolic compound was Chlorogenic acic and Caffeic acid. Various phenolic acids and flavonoids were also identified
