Impact of Chemical Reaction on MHD Free Convection Heat and Mass Transfer from Vertical Surfaces in Porous Media Considering ThermalDiffusion and Diffusion Thermo Effects
Many researchers have been studied the influence of the heat and mass transfer by natural convection in porous medium due to its many applications, such as growth of modern technologies for nuclear waste organization, heating of ground water in hot dike complexes in volcanic regions, etc. In this paper, a two dimensional steady magneto hydrodynamics (MHD) free convection flow of heat and mass transfer from a vertical surface in porous media subjected to a chemical reaction has been analyzed numerically considering thermal-diffusion and diffusionthermo effects. Here, we transformed the governing non linear partial differential equations into system of ordinary differential equations by a similar transformation to discuss the numerical solution of governing equations using implicit finite difference method. We displayed the dimensionless temperature profiles, velocity profiles and the concentration profiles graphically for the different values of the Lewis number, Soret number, Dufour number, Magnetic number, chemical reaction parameter.
