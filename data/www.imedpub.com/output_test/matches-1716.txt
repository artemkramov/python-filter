Assessment of groundwater quality with reference to fluoride, arsenic and iron in tea garden belt of Lakhimpur district, Assam, India
Ground water quality with respect to pH, iron, fluoride and arsenic has been carried out in six selected tea gardens of Lakhimpur district of Assam, India. Forty eight different sampling stations were selected for the study. Statistical analysis of the data is presented to find out the distribution pattern, localisation of data, and other related information. The study revealed that the water sources in the area are contaminated with iron and arsenic. The contamination of groundwater by arsenic and iron are attributed to geogenic origin. Statistical observations imply non uniform distribution of the studied parameters with a long asymmetric tail on the right side of the median. Thus, suitable protective measure for drinking water sources in the area is recommended.
