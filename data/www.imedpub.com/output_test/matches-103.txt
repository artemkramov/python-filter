Design and construction of a dot matrix information display for the office of the vice chancellor, Anambra State University, Uli
This is a project work done at Anambra State University, Uli. It was done in three stages namely the design, construction and working of a Dot Matrix Information Display. The project covered a fairly comprehensive study of a Dot Matrix Information Display. Digital instruments, signals, and related numbers and codes were discussed. The two possible voltage levels characterized by HIGH or LOW, ON or OFF, TRUE or FALSE, PRESENT or ABSENT were represented abstractly by the digits 0 and 1. Electronic information board, logical operations, integrated circuit, microcontroller, etc were discussed. Basic sequential and combinational digital systems were dealt with. Choices of components were made. Such components as the 8051 processor, the AT89C52 microcontroller, the LM 7805 regulator, the light emitted diode (LED), the latch 74374 IC, etc., were employed. The project has been carefully designed such that the Dot Matrix Information Display operates with electrical power from any sourcealternate or direct current. Program written in Assembly language was burned into the EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) of the system. The operation and working were enunciated. There are recommendations as the project is of outstanding quality. The feature of multiple colour makes it unique from other single colour display. It was thereafter installed at the vice chancellor’s office free from mechanical shock and vibration
