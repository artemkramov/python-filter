Checklist standard for appraisal of housing quality for urban renewal and upgrading programmes for developing nations
A comprehensive standard for the appraisal of the quality of housing units which gives no room for the subjective bias of the operator and which is simple and easy to use has been non-existent at least in the form analysts would want it during urban renewal and upgrading programmes. The major aim of this study is to articulate a reliable checklist standard for housing quality appraisal. To achieve this, a team of environmental experts and practitioners which include 4 town planners, 2 architects, 2 estate valuers who are experienced in the development and management of the built environment as well as 12 Urban and Regional Planning students was constituted. The checklist covers construction, amenities and environmental dimensions of housing. The score rating system (SRS) designed is such that aggregate of 0-30 means poor house, 31-85 means fair house while 86-100 means good house. These aggregate scores enable urban renewal operators/analysts to take up grading decisions. This checklist is highly recommended for adoption in the developing countries during urban renewal and up grading projects
