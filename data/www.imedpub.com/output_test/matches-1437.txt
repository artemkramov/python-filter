Phytochemical and chromatographic analysis of chloroform extract of Marsdenia latifelia
Marsdenia latifolia also known as Gongronema latifolium Benth is a green leafty vegetable that originated from sub-saharan Africa. The ground leaves was extracted using soxhlet apparatus and concentrated in a rotator evaporator to yield 8.0g of chloroform extract. Phytochemical screening carried out on the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids , saponins and tannins. The presence of alkaloids was confirmed using analytical TLC and preparative TLC with the aid of different solvent system and spraying with freshly prepared Dragendoff’s reagent. Tannins were confirmed to be absent through a standard test in a precoated plate and spraying with ferric chloride. Steroidal compounds were confirmed present using a precoated plate and sprayed with a mixture of 10% H2SO4 and ethanol in the ratio of 3:1.
