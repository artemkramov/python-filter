Formation, investigation and characterization of self-assembled monolayers of 5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol in corrosion protection of copper in neutral media
Self assembled monolayer is formed on copper using 5-Methyl -1,3,4-thiadiazole, 2-thiol, under optimum conditions. Corrosion behaviour of copper is studied in neutral medium of 300ppm using Gravitmetry, electrochemical (impedance, potentiodynamic polarization)studies, FT-IR, SEM, EDX, XPS and AFM studies, using 5-Methyl - 1,3,4-thiadiazole,2-thiol. Using gravimetric studies, an efficiency of 100% is obtained. Electrochemical impedance studies with high charge transfer resistance values reveal that self-assembled thiol monolayers formed offer a very high inhibition efiiciency. Potentiodynamic polarization studies have shown that SAMs formation controls both anodic and cathodic reactions. Scanning electron microscopic studies have revealed the chemisorption of nitrogen and sulphur on the metal surface. CV studies have proved the stability of SAMs and the thickness of SAMs formed can be proved through AFM studies. Thus SAMs formed using thiol offer a very good inhibition efficiency in protecting copper against corrosion
