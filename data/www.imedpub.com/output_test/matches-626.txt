Production of biodiesel via NaOH catalyzed transesterification of mahogany seed oil
This work focuses on the extraction and refining of mahogany oil from Khaya senegalensis (also known as African mahogany or dry-zone mahogany) seeds, and subsequent production of biodiesel from the refined mahogany oil. The refined mahogany oil was converted into biodiesel via NaOH catalyzed transesterification reaction. The basic properties of the synthesized mahogany biodiesel are in conformity with the ASTM D6751-06 standard for biodiesel fuel (B100). Utilization of the African mahogany seed oil for the production of biodiesel will add value to the African mahogany plant (which is mostly used for timber and fuelwood purposes) thanks to the high inedible oil content of mahogany seeds.
