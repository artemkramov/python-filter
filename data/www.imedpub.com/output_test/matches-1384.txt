Radon exhalation in some building construction materials and effect of plastering and paints on the radon exhalation rate using fired bricks
The technological endeavors of human beings have modified the levels of radiation exposure slightly. The emanation of radon is primarily associated with radium and its ultimate precursor uranium. The radiation dose received by human beings from indoor radon and its progeny is the largest of all doses received either by natural or man-made sources. In order to investigate the effect of paints available in the market on the radon exhalation rate from building materials, several bricks were collected. These bricks were plastered with a mixture of cement and sand. Before measurements, bricks were dried for 24 hours. These plastered bricks were then coated with white wash and again dried for 1-2 hours. After drying the bricks were coated with different brands and colors of paints. In the present study radon exhalation rates measurements were carried out for these painted bricks using “Sealed Can Technique”. Radon activities were found to vary from 897.4 Bq m-3 to 1514.6 Bq m-3 with an average value of 1117.5 Bq m-3. Radon exhalation rates were found to varies from 537.1 mBq m-2 h-1 to 906.5 mBq m-2 h-1 with an average value of 669.5 mBq m-2 h-1, whereas the Indoor inhalation exposure (radon) effective dose were found to varies from 63.3 μSv y-1 to 106.8 μSv y-1 with an average value of 78.9 μSv y-1
