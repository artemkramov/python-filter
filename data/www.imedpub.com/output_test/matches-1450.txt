Determination of order of kinetics of thin films of LiF using thermo luminescence technique
The thermo luminescence of several thin Films of LiF has been studied. The thermo luminescence of thin films of LiF shows a prominent glow peak at 408 K and two small shoulders, one around 458 K and the other around 662 K. Chen’s Formulae were used to calculate the trapping parameters for the observed prominent glow peak. It has been concluded that the thin films of LiF are monomolecular processes and they obey first order of kinetics
