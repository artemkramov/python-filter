Ultrasonic study of molecular interaction in binary liquid mixture containing a - picolin in ethanol at 301.15 K and 305.15K
The ultrasonic velocity (u), density (ρ) and viscosity (η) have been measured in binary liquid mixtures containing a- picolin in Ethanol at 301.15 K and 305.15 K. From these data some of acoustical parameters such as adiabatic compressibility (ba), free length (Lf), free volume (Vf) and internal pressure ( p i) have been computed using the standard relations. The excess values of these parameters are also evaluated over the whole concentration range. The result is interpreted in terms of molecular interaction such as dipole-dipole interaction through hydrogen bonding between components of mixtures. The dependence of excess properties of mixture compositions were compared and discuss in terms of the intermolecular free length and other factors affecting the solvation and selfassociation effect. The excess values of these indicate dipole-induced dipole interaction complexity in the binary liquid mixture.
