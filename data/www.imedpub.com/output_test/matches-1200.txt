Structural and thermal studies of barium doped cadmium tartrate crystals grown by gel method
The effect of Barium doped Cadmium Chloride (BCT) solution, on the size and transparency of cadmium tartrate crystal are presented in this paper by controlled diffusion of cadmium chloride into gel with tartaric acid at room temperature. Crystal size can be determined by XRD analysis. The transparency of Cadmium Tartrate can be enhancing by the Barium doping. Thermal behavior of BCT crystals were studied by using Thermo Gravimetry (TGA/DTG/DSC) which reveals, water molecules are locked up in the lattice with different strength in the grown crystals
