Uptake and localization of Lead in Eichhornia crassipes grown within a hydroponic system
Lead (Pb) uptake, localization within and around root, petiole and leaf of Eichhornia crassipes grown hydroponically in a Pb (NO3)2 solutions were studied by Scanning electron microscopy coupled with elemental Xray analysis (SEM-EDX) at different increasing concentrations of Pb. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy coupled with the elemental X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) showed upward Pb transport by root vascular tissues to leaf. Important changes in surface morphology of root and metal binding mechanism were also studied by using SEM/EDX. The photosynthetic rate of Eichhornia crassipes sharply decreased when grown in aquatic medium containing Pb.
