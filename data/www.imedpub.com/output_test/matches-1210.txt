The influence of gamma irradiation on the chemical and transport properties of porous silicon
Electrochemical cell was used to prepare Porous silicon layers from p-type silicon wafer with etching time 20 min , current 30 mA and fixed electrolyte solution HF:C2H5OH (1:4) . The research indicate the effect of the intensity increase of g-ray radiation on the transport and reflectivity properties of PSi , the investigation include the FTIR spectrum that showed an increase in the number and intensity of the vibrational modes with the increase of the radiation intensity, before irradiation the Fourier Transformtion Infrared (FTIR) spectrum demonstrate numerous vibrational modes that centered at 905, 1105 , 2087 and 2116 cm-1 belong to different functional groups while the vibrational modes happened at 827 , 948 , 1065 , 2197 and 2248 cm-1 after 50Gy gamma ray irradiation and 856, 979,1056 ,1105 ,2147 and 2192 cm-1 after 100Gy gamma irradiation .Reflectivity spectrum over a range of wavelengths (300-1200 nm) show a reduction in the reflectivity with the increase of irradiation intensity .I-V characteristics indicate that the conductivity and identity factor of the porous silicon increases with irradiation
