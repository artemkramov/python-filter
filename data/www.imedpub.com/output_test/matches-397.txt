Growth of perfect and imperfect crystals in gel: A general view
Crystals can be grown by various methods. Out of which some methods are simple and can be carried set any where such as gel method. Gel method is very simple and useful method to grow the crystals which are insoluble or slightly soluble. There are various parameters by which this method can be controlled. Once the optimum conditions were obtained, then the crystals can be grown with ease and ampoule of crystals can be obtained. In this paper, as an general idea to grow crystals has been described.Crystals can be grown by various methods.
