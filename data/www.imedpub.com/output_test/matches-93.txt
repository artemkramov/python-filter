Exploratory assessment of strength characteristics of millet husk ash (MHA) blended cement laterized concrete
The exploratory assessment of the strength characteristics of MHA blended cement laterized concrete was investigated with a view to determining its suitability as an alternative building material. It involved casting of 54 laterized concrete cubes and 27 laterized concrete beams with different percentage replacement of sand with laterite and cement with MHA in 0%, 10% and 20% replacement and cured for 7, 21 and 28 days respectively with the views of establishing the ash and laterite that will be used in cement and sand matrix. The results obtained showed that the best strength performance was obtained at 10% MHA and 0% LAT and 10% LAT and 10% MHA with strength of 19.04N/mm2 and 20.01N/mm2 which when compared with the control result (normal concrete) which is 32.98N/mm2 at 28 days for compressive strength. The flexural strength development at 28 days is 5.03 for 0% LAT and 10% MHA, 5.21N/mm2 for 10% LAT and 0% MHA and 5.10N/mm2 for 20% LAT and 0% MHA respectively. From the foregoing, MHA laterized concrete holds promise in the quest for alternative building material, and as such can be used in light weight structures such as masonry walls, walk ways
