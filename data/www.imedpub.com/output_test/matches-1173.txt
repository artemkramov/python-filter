The effect of bed nets as malarial control on population dynamics of malaria vector
Malaria is a life threatening disease caused by parasites (plasmodium spps.) which is transmitted through bite of infected mosquito. In 2012, about 219 million malaria cases and an estimated 660,000 deaths most of them are under five age children and pregnant women. Currently around three billion people (40% of the world population) are at risk of malaria. To eradicate the disease various control measures have been taken worldwide. From 1940s to 1960s DDT was used widely, and then replaced by other chemicals. The current intervention is mostly use of ITNs and/or IRS using pyrerthriod insecticide. In various Africa countries such as Kenya, Gambia, PNG, etc proper and regular use of ITNs significantly reduced morbidity and mortality rate associated with malaria in under five age children and pregnant women. However, use of pyrethroid insecticide results in the development of resistance mosquito species throughout malaria epidemic regions. Resistance development mechanisms are many and complex including behavioural or physiological change, target site alteration and metabolic processes. However, target site as well as metabolic resistance is assumed to be the main types of resistance mechanisms. A recent research result indicated that the vectors show behavioural change to avoid a contact with insecticides
