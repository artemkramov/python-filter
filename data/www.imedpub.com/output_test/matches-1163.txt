Effect of priming with botanicals and animal waste on germination and seedling vigour in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) seeds
With a view to find out the Effect of priming with botanicals and animal waste on germination and seedling vigour in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) seeds experiments was conducted in the Seed Testing Laboratory of the department of Genetics and plant breeding, Sam Higginbotham Institute of Agriculture Technology and Sciences Allahabad. In order to evaluate the effect of different seed priming techniques on germination and morphological characters of sorghum an experiment was conducted in 2013-014 in a experiment based on the complete randomized block design with two variety M35-1 (Muguti 35-1) and DSH (Dharwad sorghum hybrid). Seeds were primed for six priming media (T0- hydro priming control, Neem Leaf Extract, Parthenium Leaf Extract, Cow Urine, Coconut water and Lantana Camara Extract). Maximum seed germination percentage was observed when seed primed by Coconut water @ 3 % is best for germination %, root length, seedling length, seed vigour length, seedling shoot length, total germination and seed vigour index, followed by Cow Urine @3% similar trend was also observed in all treatment. Among the treatments LCE recorded minimum root length, germination %, Seedling Length, Seed Vigour Length, Seedling shoot length, total germination and Seed Vigour index. Among all the priming treatments, coconut water @3% was found to be the best priming treatment. Moreover priming treatments have more pronounced effect DSH maintained highest quality parameters followed than M35-1 of sorghum seeds
