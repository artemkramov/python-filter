Effects of viscous dissipation and thermal stratification on chemical reacting fluid flow over a vertical stretching surface with heat source
This paper aims to investigate the influence of chemical reaction and thermal stratification of the nonlinear MHD flow with heat and mass transfer characteristics of an incompressible, viscous, electrically conducting and Boussinesq fluid on a vertical stretching surface in the presence of viscous dissipation. A magnetic field is applied transversely to the direction of the flow. The basic equations governing the flow, heat transfer, and concentration are reduced to a set of non linear ordinary differential equations by using appropriate transformation for variables. The non linear ordinary differential equations are first linearised using Quasi-linearization and solved numerically by an implicit finite difference scheme. Then the system of algebraic equations is solved by using Gauss-Seidal iterative method. The effects of physical parameters on the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles are illustrated graphically. Velocity, Temperature and concentration profiles drawn for different controlling parameters reveal that the flow field is influenced appreciably by the presence of thermal stratification, chemical reaction, magnetic field and viscous dissipation.
