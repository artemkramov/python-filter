Estimation of sedimentary thickness in eastern Anambra basin by qualitative and quantitative interpretation of Aeromagnetic data
Aeromagnetic data over Eastern Anambra basin was assembled, filtered and interpreted to determine the sedimentary thickness details in the study area. Data digitizing was performed to reduced flight noise and for data enhancement and processing. The enhancement of magnetic anomalies associated with fault and other structural discontinuities was achieved by the application of band pass filter. The residual was obtained by separation of regional field from magnetic field by method of linear regression analysis. Qualitative interpretation was done by visual inspection of the anomaly contour map while quantitative interpretation was estimated using Peters’ half slope method. Interpretation of the results show that the floor of the basin is characterized by block faults whose widths lie between 15 and 45km, trends in Northeast-Southwest and East-West direction with average sedimentary thickness of 4.56km.
