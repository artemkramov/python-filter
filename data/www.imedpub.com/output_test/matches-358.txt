Hall effect on radiating and chemically reacting MHD oscillatory flow in a rotating porous vertical channel in slip flow regime
An investigation of the combined influence of Hall effects and chemical reaction on the flow of an oscillatory convective MHD viscous, incompressible, radiating and electrically conducting fluid in a vertical porous rotating channel in slip flow regime is carried out. The fluid is assumed to be gray, absorbing and emitting radiation out in non scattering medium. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow is assumed to be laminar and fully developed. A closed form solutions of the equations governing the flow are obtained for the velocity, temperature and concentration profile. The velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles as well as skin friction coefficient and mass transfer rate are evaluated numerically and presented graphically for different value of flow parameters.
