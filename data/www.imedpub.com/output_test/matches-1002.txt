Formation of binary and ternary complex of Cu (II) with amitriptyline hydrochloride and furosemide as primary ligands and amino acids as secondary ligands
Mixed ligand stability constant of copper complexes with Amitriptyline hydrochloride and Furosemide drug with aminoacid, Isoleucine and Glutamic acid have been studied pH metrically in 20% v/v ethyl alcohol water medium at 300C temperature and 0.1 M ionic strength. The equilibrium constant of copper ternary complexes have been correlated with ΔlogK, KL, KR and Kr stability related parameters. The percentage concentrations of various possible species with pH were determined by using computer program and possible equilibria were predicted
