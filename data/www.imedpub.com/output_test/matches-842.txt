Effects of thermal radiation and chemical reaction on MHD free convection flow past a moving vertical plate with heat source and convective surface boundary condition
This paper analyzes the heat and mass transfer effects on MHD steady two-dimensional laminar free convective boundary layer flow of a viscous incompressible radiating fluid, past a moving vertical plate in the presence of chemical reaction. The left surface of the plate is in contact with hot fluid, while the stream of cold fluid flows along the right surface. The governing boundary layer equations of continuity, momentum, energy and concentration are transformed into nonlinear ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations, and then solved by Runge-Kutta method along with shooting technique. The effects of various material parameters on the velocity, temperature and concentration as well as the skin friction coefficient, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are represented in graphs and tables and discussed in detail. It is found that there is a good agreement between the present results and existing results, in the reduced cases
