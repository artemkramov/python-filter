Optimization of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles synthesis to fabricate glucose oxidase sensor
Nanostructured Zinc oxide (ZnO) is inherently electro-catalytic by nature, thus finding application in the field of enzyme immobilization while also keeping its biological activity undamaged and therefore these nanomaterials are utilized for the construction of biosensors. The electrochemical behavior of zinc oxide is the result of the combined characteristics of electrochemistry as they have high speed, sensitivity, simplicity &amp; also have lower limits of detection. Metal oxide nanoparticle modified electrochemical interfaces provides with larger electrochemically active surface areas which improves the performance of the biosensor because these metal oxide nanoparticles demonstrate higher ratios of surface area to volume as compared with their other counterparts in bulk form. In this particular study we prepared the nanoparticles from metal oxide first and then these zinc oxide nanoparticles are combined with glucose oxidase (GOx). After this step the UV- Spectrum helps in the structural confirmation of GOx is preserved after conjugation with ZnO nanoparticles. The main reason behind combining zinc oxide nanoparticles with glucose oxidase (GOx) is to enhance the current sensitivity of the GOx enzyme electrode. In 10 mM solution of β-D-glucose we observe the current response of ZnO nanoparticle containing the enzyme electrode increasing from 0.78 to 22 μA cm -2 . Response surface optimization of current response is done using Design expert. The optimum conditions for effective current response were pH, working potential and temperature. The fabricated electrode showed 79.6% stability after 1 month of successive uses.
