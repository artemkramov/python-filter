Present Status and Habitat Ecology of Ompok pabo (Ham-Buchanan) in Goronga Beel, Morigaon; Assam (India)
In the present communication, habitat ecology of Ompok pabo (Ham-Buchanan) in Goronga beel (Wetland), Morigaon; Assam were studied from September 2007 to August 2009. The wetland is riverine in origin and lies between the latitude of 190 2/ E and longitude of 26015/ N. The endangered fish, Ompok pabo now restricted only few natural habitat including this wetland. Physico-chemical attributes of the wetland showed within permissible limit to support significantly in habitat suitability of the species. A total of 77 species recorded from the wetland during the period of investigation. The less recorded species in Bagridae family was also help in habitat suitability of Ompok pabo. The Shannon–Weiner diversity index of fish population of the wetland ranged from 2.11 to 3.41, which significantly indicates maximum species richness of the wetland. The floral and other faunal diversity of the wetland also showed important role in shaping microhabitat of the species.
