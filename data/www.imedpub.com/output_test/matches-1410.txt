Variation in the fatty acid profile of lion fishes Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758) and Pterois antennata (Bloch, 1787) of Parangipettai coast, Tamil Nadu, India
An attempt has been made to invigorate the fatty acid profile of two different lion fishes such as P.volitans and P.antennata. Dominant quantity of SFA was noticed as 45.35%, 41.98% and 37.90 % in the liver, abdominal muscle and ovarian tissues of P.antennata than P.volitans. Significantly a low level of 42.35%, 40.98% and 35.04 % was observed in the above tissues of P.volitans. A maximum SFA was noticed in the testes and ovaries of P.antennata than P.volitans. A higher percentage composition of 37 % MUFA was observed in the liver of P.volitans than P.antennata. The percentage composition of 40.02% SFA was found in the abdominal muscle of P.volitans than 38.67 % in the marine lion fish P.antennata. Whereas the level varied reversely as 42.02% and 41.02 % in P.antennata and P.volitans respectively in the liver of both the species. A maximum SFA profile was observed in the testes and ovaries of P.antennata than P.volitans. A higher percentage composition of 37 % MUFA was observed in the liver of P.volitans than P.antennata. The MUFA level of 26.07 % found more in the testes of P.volitans which is comparatively less of 25.38 % in P.antennata. There was no much differences were observed with PUFA concentration of the liver of male lion fishes of both species. Levels (Percentage) of SFA, MUFA, PUFA and HUFA of different tissues of male and female of both the species of lion fishes. There was no significant difference noticed among the species and between tissues of male female fishes. Correlation matrix among the tissues of test organisms namely fishes was resembled with the value p &lt; 0.01
