Comparative study of heavy metals concentration in some water bodies of EKET and NSIT Ubium local government area of Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria
A study of the heavy metals concentration in some water bodies of Nsit Ubium and Eket local government area of Akwa Ibom State was investigated between June and December 2012. Surface water from six rivers located in different parts of the two local government area was collected and analysed for the presence of heavy metals. The following range of values were obtained, Iron (Fe) 0.82±2.10 - 87±2.04 mg/l, Manganese (Mn) 0.22±1.21 - 0.37±1.24 mg/l, Copper (Cu) 0.13±0.71 - 0.25±0.68 mg/l, Zinc (Zn) 0.31±0.61 - 0.37±0.61 mg/l, Cobalt (Co) 0.02±0.01 - 0.04±0.01 mg/l, Nickel (Ni) 0.42±0.32 - 0.52±0.31 mg/l in Eket LGA while in Nsit Ubium, Iron (Fe) ranged between 1.11±0.90 - 1.20±1.90 mg/l, Manganese (Mn) 0.18±0.01 - 0.27±0.01 mg/l, Copper (Cu) 0.03±0.21 - 0.42±0.28 mg/l, Zinc (Zn) 0.21±0.028 - 0.27±0.034mg/l, Cobalt (Co) 0.01±0.01 - 0.02±0.01 mg/l, Nickel (Ni) 0.54±0.01 - 0.64±0.01 mg/l respectively. The concentrations of the various heavy metals falls within the recommended values World Health Organization standards for drinking water. However, Iron and copper were above the WHO recommended safe level. This shows that water bodies around Eket were more polluted with heavy metals (Iron and copper) than water bodies in Nsit Ubium. Thus water from the investigated rivers in Eket area is not safe for portability. However, it can be treated to enhance its use for portability and for other domestic purposes.
