Synthesis and Characterization of Local Impurities Doped Stannous Iodide (SnI2) Crystal in Silica Gel
Crystals of un- doped and local impurities doped Stannous Iodide (SnI2) were grown by sol gel technique. The optical properties of the materials were determined using a JENWAY 6405 UV-VIS spectrophotometer operating at a wavelength range of 200nm to 1200nm at an interval of 5nm. The crystallite size lies between 2.70 – 3.05 showing that they are polymer nano materials. The average refractive index (n) is between 0.6 and 2.9. The band gaps are from 3.2 to 4.3 showing that they are wide band gap materials and are good refractory materials.
