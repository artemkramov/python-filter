Effects of reinforcement loading on physical and mechanical properties of developed recycled low density polyethylene/maize cob ash particulate (PLDP/MCAp) composite
Efforts made to recycle empty water sachet (commonly called pure water nylon) and maize cob, into a useful material of good physical and mechanical properties have been reported. The effects of reinforcement loading on the physical and mechanical properties of the developed composite material have now been established. The empty water sachet was used as a matrix, which was reinforced by maize cob ash particulate and the composites were compounded and compressively moulded. The results obtained reveal that both the physical and mechanical properties measured such as hardness values, density, young’s modulus, flexural strength and impact energy increase with loading of the maize cob ash particulate up to a range of 20-25wt% MCAp loading then fall on further addition. For optimum service conditions, maize cob particles addition should not exceed 25% to ensure better performance
