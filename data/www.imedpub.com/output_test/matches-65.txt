Influence of mercury on the body weight of Isa brown hibrid
The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of Hg ions on the body weight of the birds of hybrid Isa brown. In this study we have analyzed the influence of the Hg ion in the body weight during treatment within 19 days. We used HgCl2 solid, dissolved in distillate water in different concentrations: 50, 100, 200 mg/l. We have used four groups, three of them we treated with different concentrations of Hg and one was as standard. Every group contains 6 birds of the hybrid Isa brown. We found that control group has increased the body weight for 11.67 g/day. The group which we have treated with 50mg Hg/l has increased the body weight for 12.14 g/day. When we treat with 100 mg Hg /l the body weight of hybrid Isa brown was increased for 15.48 g/day. Using the concentration of 200 mg Hg/l the body weight was increased for 10 g/day. From these results we can conclude that Hg ions have influence in the body weight of the hybrid Isa brown
