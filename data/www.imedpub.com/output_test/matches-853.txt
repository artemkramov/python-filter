Electrical and optical properties modification of polystyrene by Vanadium (V) ion-pair organometallic complex
The present study focused on the modification of the electrical and optical properties of polystyrene films with salt additive, namely, (n-butylammonium-oxobis (8-quinolyloxo) Vanadium(V)[VO2O2]+ [(n.BuNH2)2]- , by preparing the composites with different percentage (2,3,4,5,6) wt% of this ion-pair additive. The experimental results show that the DC electrical conductivity for all composites is increased by several orders of magnitude with increasing filler contact. The activation energy is also determined and found to decrease with increasing filler concentration. The optical data were analyzed and interpreted in term of electronic transitions
