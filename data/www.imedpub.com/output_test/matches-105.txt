Kinetics and mechanistic approach to the oxidation of L-tryptophan by permanganate ion in aqueous acidic medium
The kinetics of permanganate ion oxidation of L-tryptophan (LT) in aqueous tetraoxosulphate(VI) acid solution at a constant ionic strength of 0.50mol dm-3 at 28± 1OC has been investigated spectrophotometrically. The reaction showed a first order dependence on both - 4 [MnO ] and [LT]. The rate of reaction decreased as the ionic strength of the medium increased. Added anions and cations catalysed the reaction, the result of the Michaelis Menten’s analysis and spectroscopic investigation gave no evidence of intermediate complex formation. On the basis of the results obtained in this study, the outer sphere mechanism is proposed for the . reaction.
