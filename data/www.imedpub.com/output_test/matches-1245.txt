Physicochemical studies of bore wells underground water samples
Physicochemical analysis of bore wells underground water samples were collected from different places of Bhusawal (India). These six samples of water samples from different places were analyzed for their physicochemical characteristics. Water is an important part of human life, Physicochemical analysis of underground water was carried out during April 2014. All the samples were collected from the different places. People used water for drinking and irrigation purpose these water samples from six different places of Bhusawal, were analyzed for their physicochemical characteristics. Laboratory tests were performed for analysis as Temperature Calcium, Magnesium, hardness, total hardness; pH, Chloride, Alkalinity, TDS, Conductivity, sulphate, phosphate, nitrate &amp; COD were studied. The usefulness of these parameters in predicting ground water quality characteristics were discussed. Thus an attempt has been made to find the quality of ground water in and around Bhusawal suitable for drinking purposes after proper purification
