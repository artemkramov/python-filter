Determination of some metal contaminants from industrial effluents in North- West Nigeria using k0-NAA Standardization Method
The k0-NAA standardization method has been applied to investigate the metal contents of industrial effluents collected at several sites in North-Western part of Nigeria. Ten elements (Cr, Co, Ca, Na, Eu, Hf, Th, Dy, Sb and Cs) were determined from 10 samples from the leather, textile and petrochemical industries. The enrichment factors were determined by comparison of the elemental concentration with that of a typical soil from non-industrial area within the same locality of the survey. Some of the industrial effluents had high elevated concentration for chromium, calcium, cobalt, sodium, antimony and dysprosium.
