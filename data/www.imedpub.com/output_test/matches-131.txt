Corrosion Inhibition of Mild Steel in Acid Media by Red Peanut skin extractfurfural resin
The resin formed with red peanut skin extract (RPSE) and furfural has been studied as a possible inhibitor for corrosion of Mild Steel in 1M HCl at 30-50oC by weight loss measurement. The corrosion rate of mild steel and the inhibition efficiencies of the resin were calculated. The studies reveal that at constant acid concentration, the resin acts as an effective inhibitor for mild steel corrosion in HCl media. Inhibition efficiency increases with increase in the concentration of the resin and temperature. The adsorption of the resin was in accordance with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm at all the temperature studied. The mechanism of chemical adsorption is proposed for the inhibitory action of the resin.
