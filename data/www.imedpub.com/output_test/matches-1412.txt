The pertinence of training and development and their components in non-training standards from the viewpoints of the managers and experts of the manufacturing-service organizations in Iran
The purpose of this study is to investigate the pertinence of training and its components in non-training standards from the viewpoints of the managers and experts of the manufacturing-service organizations in Iran. It is a functional research in purpose. The research method is a mixed one consisting of qualitative and quantitative methods. For data collection and quantitative analysis, the questionnaire was used through a survey method and the categorization is also applied qualitatively. The statistical population includes all the managers and experts of human resources training and development in manufacturing-service organizations in Iran and 64 of them were selected as the research sample through simple sampling. In this study three training standards and 11 non-training standards were weighted and analyzed. In the content analysis with a categorization approach, 9 components were identified and weighted. The data analysis is presented in two general sections: 1) the training experts’ viewpoints toward evaluating and prioritizing training components and 2) the perspectives of the managers and the experts toward the pertinence of training components in non-training standards. In the first section, competence was the most important component while the training strategy was considered the least important one. The most prominent point presented in the second section is that “the pertinence of training in the non-training standards is generally inappropriate”.
