Optimum Location of Dust Bins Using Geo-Spatial Technology: A Case Study of Kumbakonam Town, Tamil Nadu, India
Urbanization and changing consumption patterns are resulting in the generation of increasing amounts of solid waste and visible environmental problem in many urban areas. It creates more environmental problems, as many cities are not able to manage it due to institutional, regulatory, financial, technical, and public participation shortcomings. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average Indian generates about 490 grams of waste per day. There is strong evidence which suggests that individual or group awareness and attitudes towards waste generation and management is critical in the effort to respond to the waste management challenge. The rapid growing of Kumbakonam Town faces problems in poor solid waste handling for a large part of its population. The present study was focused on household solid waste disposal and optimum location of dust bins to access and maximize its utilization. The field data collected with help of Global Positioning System survey was transformed into SPSS .v.16. For the empirical survey; existing location of dust bins, and household population with distance from home were collected. Finally, finding the alternate location of dust bins and mapping.
