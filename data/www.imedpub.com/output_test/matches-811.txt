Physicochemical properties and microorganisms isolated from dried meat obtained in Oja- Oba market in Ilorin, Nigeria
The physicochemical properties and microorganisms isolated from dried meat samples obtained from the Oja-Oba market in Ilorin metropolis during the rainy season were investigated. Meat samples were stored under two storage conditions (cupboard and refrigerator) before they were analysed using potato dextrose agar and nutrient agar for fungi and bacteria load of the dried meat samples. Analytical studies on the nutritional contents (moisture content, total amino acid content, titratable acidity and protein content) of the dried meat samples stored under a period of five weeks revealed that the moisture content of dried meat samples stored in the cupboard increased from 35% to 65%, while those in the refrigerator had an initial increase from 50% to 55% for the first two weeks of storage and became constant through the period of storage. The total amino acid content ranged from 0.2128-0.5040mg/g and 0.2464-0.5376mg/g for both samples respectively. Titratable acidity ranged from 0.04mg/g-0.10mg/g and 0.07mg/g-0.14mg/g for both samples respectively. The increase in protein content recorded for both meat samples ranged from 5.79-14.02mg/g and 5.11-13.52mg/g respectively. Bacteria and fungi isolated include Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Neisseria sp., Acinetobacter sp., Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp. and Rhizopus sp. The total bacterial count increased in the dried meat stored in the cupboard (2.5 × 10-7 to 3.3 × 10-7cfu/ml) while it decreased in the meat samples stored in the refrigerator (2.0 × 10-7 to 1.4 × 10-7cfu/ml).
