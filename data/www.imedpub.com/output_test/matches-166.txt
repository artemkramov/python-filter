Vermicomposting of Distillery sludge with different wastes by using Eisenia fetida
The aim of the study is to utilize distillery sludge with different types of waste i.e. agricultural waste, municipal waste and poultry waste through vermicomposting by using Eisenia fetida. The experiments were conducted in circular plastic containers. The containers were filled with three different combinations of distillery sludge and different wastes in 1:1 (distillery sludge + different waste), 1:3 (distillery sludge + different waste), and 3:1 (distillery sludge + different waste) were prepared. In the experimental period (60 days), different chemical parameters were analyzed within a time interval of 15 days. The Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (%), Available Phosphorus (%) and Total Potassium (%) – increased at the end of the process, while the % Organic Carbon decreased as the vermicomposting processes progressed.
