In this paper we report the synthesis and characterization of transparent polymer nanocomposites Polystyrene/ ZnS: Mn. ZnS: Mn nanoparticles have been synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method. PS/Zns: Mn nanocomposites are prepared with different concentrations of ZnS: Mn in PS. These are characterized using XRD, SEM,EDAX, UV-Vis Spectroscopy and PL studies.XRD results indicate the cubic crystalline nature of ZnS.An Yellow Orange emission is obtained in the nanocomposites which are characteristic of ZnS: Mn nanoparticles and is preserved in PS/ ZnS: Mn
