Drinking water has great effects on human health. This research throws light on to the physico-chemical analysis of drinking water in Kadegaon Tahsil, Maharashtra (India). In present study two different scenarios were compared: Well water and bore well water. The parameters such as water temperature, total dissolved solid, hardness, pH, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, conductivity and chloride, were analyzed from period of 1 Aug 2016–10 Oct 2016.
