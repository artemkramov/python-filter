Spectral characterization and thermal behavior of Schiff base metal complex derived from 2-aminobenzimidazole
The Ni(II) complex of Schiff base derived from 2-Aminobenzimidazole with Salicylaldehyde has been synthesized keeping in view that some metal complexes are found to be more potent than their parent drugs. The synthesized complex has been characterized by elemental analysis, conductivity measurements, IR, UV, magnetic susceptibility and TGA studies. The molar conductance measurement of the complex in DMF indicates its weak molecular nature. The spectroscopic studies shows the presence of azomethine nitrogen in coordination to the metal ion and octahedral geometry of the metal complex has been proposed. The thermal decomposition of the complex was studied and indicates that not only the lattice water is lost but also the decomposition of ligand from the complex is necessary to interpret the successive mass loss
