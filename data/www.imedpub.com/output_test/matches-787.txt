Study of acoustical parameters of substituted aminopyrimidine by ultrasonic technique
Ultrasonic velocity and density of substituted aminopyrimidine in 70% DMF solvent have been measured at300Kanddifferent concentration. The experimental data is used to calculate adiabatic compressibility (βS), specific acoustic impedance (Z) and intermolecular free length (Lf). The acoustical parameters are explained on the basis of molecular interactions between the components of the mixtures. The variations of these parameters with composition of the mixture suggest the strength of molecular interactions in these mixtures
