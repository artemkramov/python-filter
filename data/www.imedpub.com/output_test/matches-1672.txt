Nuclear structure of the germanium nuclei in the interacting Boson model (IBM)
The structure of some even-even Ge isotopes have been studied within the framework of the interacting boson model. The positive parity states, B(E2), B(M1) and δ(E2/M1) values of the above nuclei have been calculated. The IBM-2 results obtained for Ge have been compared with the previous experimental and theoretical values obtained on the basis of the interacting boson model (IBM-2). The sufficient aspects of model leading to the E(5) symmetry have been proved by presenting E(5) characteristic of the Ge nuclei
