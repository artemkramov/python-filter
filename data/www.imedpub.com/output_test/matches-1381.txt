Numerical simulation of turbulent forced convection in a venturi channel with fully developed flow at the inlet
In this work, a 2D turbulent forced convection air flow in a venturi channel has been numerically simulated using fluent. Transfers equations are described by the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) and the vicious model is the turbulent standard k-ε model. A fully-developed power-law profile is assumed for the inlet stream wise velocity. The results are presented as velocity field, static and dynamic pressures fields, streamlines field, vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy fields. They show that the region of maximum turbulent kinetic energy is the diffuser wall region extending to the channel exit and the turbulence shifts away from the diffuser wall in the flow direction
