Red sanders, Pterocarpus santalinus L. in Rajampet forest range, Rajampet forest division, Andhra Pradesh, India
Red sanders, Pterocarpus santalinus Linn.f., is globally endangered, endemic tree to India, included in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, Geneva, Switzerland) Appendix II in 1995. Illegal harvest is a key threat to P. santalinus since legal felling of P. santalinus in natural stands is ceased in India. It was reported that the population of P. santalinus in its native range is diminishing in an exponential rate, hence a study has been conducted to understand the present status of red sanders in Rajampet Forest Division, Andhra Pradesh, India, where P. santalinus is thickly populated. The study revealed that the standing crops are pole crops, not suitable for harvesting.
