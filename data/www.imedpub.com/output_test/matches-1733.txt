Comparative study of intestinal helminths and protozoa of cattle and goats in Abakaliki metropolis of Ebonyi State, Nigeria
The comparative study of gut helminthes and protozoa of cattle and goats in Abakaliki metropolis was carried out between March and June 2009. Out of 569 samples collected from cattle, 50.79% were positive of gut helminthes which includes Fasciola spp Paramphistomum spp Trichostrongylus spp, Trichuris spp, Nematodirus spp and Coeperia spp, there was no significance difference obtained. Comparatively, 370 fecal samples were collected from goats, where 42.43% were positive for gut helminthes parasites except Paraphistomum spp, while 16.22% goats were positive for gut protozoan parasites (Eimeria spp), there was no significance difference for helminthes parasites of goats assesed. There were some incidence of mixed gut helminthes parasites in cattle and goats though there was no mixed trematode infection in goats. Also incidence of mixed gut helminth and protozoa parasites were noticed in cattle and goats, though there was no mixed Nematodirus and Eimeria parasites in cattle and no mixed Paramphistomum and Eimeria parasites in goats. From this result, trematodes were more dominant in cattle than in goats, while protozoa parasites were not much prevalent and may be attributed to good hygienic condition. While the moderately high prevalence of cattle and goats may be attributed to the season of the study
