The population difference in sequential learning, value transfer ability of climbing perch (Anabas Testudineus-Bloch)
Sequential learning and value transfer ability of climbing perch collected from lentic and lotic ecosystems were studied. The results indicate that the Anabas testudineus able to associate the reward with a colour and capable of transfer the value sequentially to another colour. Difference in habitat has marked influence on the ability for sequential learning and transfer of value. Fish collected from lotic ecosystem exhibited higher ability for sequential learning and value transfer as compared with fish collected from lentic ecosystem. Chemical parameters of water and sediments of aquatic ecosystem have a determinant role on the maintenance of the life of the fish, the physical parameters can alter the development of their behaviour and cognitive abilities. Importance of natural habitat and population difference in the development of learning capacity of the fish is discussed.
