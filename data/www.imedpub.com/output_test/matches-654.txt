Effect of viscous dissipation on unsteady periodic MHD poiseuille flow with transpiration cooling and thermal radiation
This paper deals with the effects of heat and mass transfer on unsteady periodic flow of a viscous incompressible and electrically conducting fluid in a horizontal channel taking into consideration the effect of internal heating by viscous dissipation. The lower stationary plate and the upper plate in unsteady periodic motion are subjected to a same constant injection and suction velocity respectively. The temperature of the upper plate in periodic motion various periodically with time. The flow in the channel is also acted upon by periodic variation of pressure gradient. A magnetic field of uniform strength is applied in the direction normal to the plates. A closed form solution of the problem is obtained. The effects of various flow parameters on the velocity, temperature and concentration fields have been discussed. The skin friction and rate of heat and mass transfer are obtained. The results are presented and discussed with the help of graphs.
