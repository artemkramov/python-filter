Analysis of electrical resistivity data for the determination of aquifer depth at Sapele RD in Benin city
The importance of groundwater cannot be overemphasized. For this reason, the exploration for water and its purification is therefore a vital aspect of Geophysics. The resistivity method of surveying was carried out for the study of underground aquifer at Sapele road in Benin-City, Edo State, Nigeria. Data were acquired using the ABEM Terrameter 300B using the Schlumberger array. Two locations were considered, and for each location, the vertical electrical sounding was used to obtain readings for resistance and the apparent resistivities. The results obtained showed that water bearing formation for the two survey areas, was found at depths of 17.98m for VES 1 and 32.43m for VES 2
