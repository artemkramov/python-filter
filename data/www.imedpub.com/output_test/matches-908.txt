Efficacy of herbal composition against ectoparasite infestation in dogs
Welfare of domestic animals is challenged by ectoparasite infestation throughout world. These ticks harbour disease causing pathogens that plays role in impact on public health. Various efforts are being undertaken to develop formulations that are safe to environment and cost effective. The skin lesion due to infestation needs to be controlled and to minimize reinfestation of causative agent’s viz., ticks and fleas. The available methods of treatment are predominantly chemical in nature. In this aspect, indigenous veterinary medications can afford sustainable technologies through appropriate scientific intervention. Some of these herbal medications were found to be novel and it is pertinent to explore efficacy of this knowledge through clinical trials. The research study found that five percent herbal composition of an indigenous herbal medication (AHP/PR/ET) had effectively cured tick and flea infestation in naturally infested dogs.The formulation had demonstrated effective control over tick infestation and desired impact was found on seventh day of experimentation. The medication had shown significant (p &lt; 0.05) control against flea infestation on seventh day of treatment. The reoccurrence of these parasites were not noticed during 21 day observation period. The skin inflammation due to ectoparasite was found reduced and relieved affected animals from constant irritation. The medication was administered once a day for two days with interval of twenty four hours, enhancing ease of administration. These environment friendly formulations need to be encouraged for protecting animal health and welfare
