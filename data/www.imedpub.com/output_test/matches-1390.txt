A quantitative study of the dynamical conductivity of the heavy electron compounds CeAl3 and UPt3
We report a temperature dependent calculation of the dynamical conductivity of two heavy electron compounds CeAl3 and  . Heavy-electron systems are electrically conducting materials with peculiar low-temperature physical properties that distinguish them from ordinary metals. The range of temperature studied is from 1.2K to 10K. Marked difference in behavior is observed in this range. The results compare qualitatively well with experimental studies.
