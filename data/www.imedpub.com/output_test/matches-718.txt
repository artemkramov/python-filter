Genome study of North-East Indian Rubus alceifolius
An attempt was made to isolate genomic DNA along with the estimation of nuclear DNA content of North-East Indian Rubus alceifolius. A simple, efficient and reliable CTAB method is standardized for isolation of genomic DNA from fresh young leaves of R. alcifolius after modifying some of the key steps of earlier protocol described by Khanuja et al. (1999). The modified procedure yielded a high amount (38 μg g-1 fresh leaf tissue) of good quality DNA free from contaminants and found to be suitable for restriction digestion with Eco RI and Hind III enzymes. The nuclear DNA content of R. alceifolius was estimated by one step DNA flow cytometry procedure (Otto, 1990) with slight modifications. The 2C DNA content of this species was estimated to be 5.681 pg. This is the first study attempted for determination of nuclear DNA content of North-East Indian R. alceifolius.
