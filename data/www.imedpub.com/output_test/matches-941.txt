Synthesis, growth and characterization of dibromo thiosemicarbazide cadmium (II) chloride monohydrate-A semiorganic nonlinear optical single crystal
One of the metal-organic nonlinear optical materials, dibromo thiosemicarbazide cadmium (II) chloride monohydrate (DBTSCCC) was synthesized. Solubility of DBTSCCC was determined in double distilled water at different temperatures. Three dimensional crystal structure of the grown crystal was determined by single crysatal X-ray diffraction study. FT-IR study confirms the formation of the expected compound. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses were carried out to study the thermal stability of the crystal. UV-vis-NIR spectrum recorded from 2 mm thick crystals shows ~65% transmitted in the wavelength region of 390-1100 nm. Linear optical constants such as extinction coefficient and refractive index were calculated. Optical nonlinearities of dibromo thiosemicarbazide cadmium (II) chloride monohydrate were investigated by Z-scan technique with He-Ne laser radiation of wavelength 632.8 nm. Mechanical properties of the grown crystal were studied using Vickers microhardness test. Second harmonic generation efficiency of the powdered dibromo thiosemicarbazide cadmium (II) chloride monohydrate was estimated using Nd: YAG laser and is ~7.0 times that of potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate
