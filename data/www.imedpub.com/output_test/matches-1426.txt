Removal of Cu &amp; Fe from aqueous solution by using eggshell powder as low cost adsorbent
In the present work, the adsorption efficiency of eggshell powder for the removal of Cu and Fe studied. Calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate &amp; calcium phosphate are the main constituents of eggshell powder, which have good adsorption capacity. The research is a batch scale experiment using different amount of adsorbent in solution with five different concentrations (5, 10, 20, 40, 100 mg/L) of both metals and in mixed combination. About 85% to 95% Fe removal achieved by using 0.5 to 1.5 g adsorbent for solution having concentration of 5 and 10 mg/L of Fe. Two main things comes out by the above study, first, the adsorption efficiency depends on the amount of adsorbent as the adsorption efficiency of Cu was increased from 80% to 95% in the same solution (5mg/L). Second, it a also found that adsorption efficiency was decreased about 7 % and 3% of Fe and Cu to mixed metal solution, which clearly indicates that the presence of more metals in the solution will decrease the adsorption efficiency
