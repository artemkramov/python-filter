Durability of block work: the effect of varying water/cement ratio of mortar joint
The majority of masonry structures exhibit excellent long-term performance with comparative low maintenance cost. Durability of a masonry structure is influenced by many factors including the durability of both blocks units and mortar joint. In this research the specific influence of the varying water cement ratio of the mortar joint is taken into consideration. Hence the varying water/cement ratio is seen to affect the compressive strength results of the specimens produced for the purpose of this investigation, as it was found that compressive strength of the brickmortar couplets generally reduces when water-cement ratio value was high. From the foregoing designers should not ignore this factor when targeting a desirable strength for masonry construction.
