Agitation leaching recovery of lead and zinc from complex sulphide ore deposit using HF, HCL and H2SO4
The paper presents laboratory report on leach study of a particular ZnS ore using a range of concentrated acid. The authors carried out this work as prelude to a more systematic study on the considerable body of knowledge in processing this type of ore in terms of the Roast-Leach-Electrowin process and then considered the extent to which this method is applicable to their specific ore. The ore was roasted in air and leached in three acids HF, HCl and H2SO4 using agitation leaching method with variation in leaching time and molar concentration of acids. The effect of increasing the concentration of leachants shows that both metals have higher values of recovery at lower concentration ranging from 1~3M of HF, and at 1M of HCl and H2SO4. Highest Zn dissolution was obtained in 6M H2SO4 and HF; 1M HCl while Pb recovery in the trend of HF, HCl and M H2SO4.
