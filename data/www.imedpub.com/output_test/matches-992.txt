Anti-salmonella activities of Mangifera indica seed kernel aqueous extract (MISKAE)
To assess antibacterial activities of MISKAE on Salmonella sp., isolated from Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE). Salmonella causes major AGE outbreaks among children. It also causes typhoid and intestinal invasive infections. Antibiotics are used for the treatment of these infections. Now a day, microorganism’s develope resistance. Alternative treatment strategy is needed to curtail the effect of Salmonella. Traditional System of Medicine (TSM) is most useful for the treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. MISK is selected and extracted using water (MISKAE). It was subjected for antimicrobial assay by disc diffusion method. MIC, MBC, % inhibition, IC50 along with qualitative phytochemical analysis of this plant extracts were done using standard methods. results revealed that MISKAE showed good antisalmonella activity and produce 7.3±0.6 to 15.0±1.0mm zone of inhibition at 200μg/disc concentration. MISKAE showed good MIC and MBC with 98.8% inhibition at 200μg/ml concentration for Salmonella typhi 14. IC50 required for killing Salmonella ranges from 101.3 to 800 μg/ml concentration. MISKAE could be considered as a effective medicine for the treatment of Salmonella infection. Flavonoid, Tannins and Polyphenols were considered as a chemical prevents or inhibits the growth of Salmonella
