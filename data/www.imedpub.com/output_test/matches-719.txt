Viscous Dissipation Effects on Unsteady free convection and Mass Transfer Flow past an Accelerated Vertical Porous Plate with Suction
The unsteady free convection and mass transfer boundary layer flow past an accelerated infinite vertical porous plate with suction by taking into account the viscous dissipation is considered when the plate accelerates in its own plane. The governing equations were solved numerically by using Galerkin Finite element method. The flow phenomenon has been characterized with the help of flow parameters such as suction parameter (a), porosity parameter (α), Grashof number (Gr, Gc), Schmidt number (Sc) and Prandtl number (Pr), Eckert number . The effects of these parameters on the velocity field, temperature field and concentration distribution have been studied and the results are presented graphically and discussed quantitatively
