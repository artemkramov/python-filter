Analysis of heavy metals in fish samples along the east coastal region of Valinokkam, Ramanathapuram District, Tamilnadu
Heavy metals are non-biodegradable which cause cytotoxic and carcinogenic effects in animals. Being at top of the aquatic food chain fish constitute a major source of heavy metal in food. The variation of Lead, Cadmium, Nickel, Copper and Cobalt concentrations in Muscle, Gill and Kidney of four fish species (Dussumieria acuta, Tenuaslosa ilisha, Sardinella longiceps and Caranx hippos) were collected along East Coast of Valinokkam. In this study we have used inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique for determination of heavy metals. The results revealed that the average concentration of the trace metals in selected organs of fish species were in the ranking order of Cu&gt;Pb&gt;Cd&gt;Ni&gt;Co indicating presence of Cu in higher concentration and Co in low concentration among the metals. Almost all heavy metal concentrations in the marine fishes are below the threshold levels associated with the toxicological effects and the regulatory limits. The bio-concentration factors revealed that the fishes have accumulated heavy metals along the food chain rather than from water column and sediment.
