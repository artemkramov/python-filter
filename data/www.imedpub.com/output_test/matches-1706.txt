Determination of trace pentachlorophenol (PCP) in wastewater using solid phase extraction
Pentachloromethane (PCP) is one of highly toxic of polychlorophenols and required to continuously monitor. This paper presenting a sensitive method using high performance liquid chromatography HPLC for trace determination of this compound. The retention time for PCP in this study was found to be 12.9 minutes and the chromatographic parameters were established through this study. The average concentration of PCP in waste water samples was 126.5 μg/L before treatment and dropped to 44 – 95 μg/L after treatment
