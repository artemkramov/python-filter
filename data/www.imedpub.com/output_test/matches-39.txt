(4-Sulfobutyl)tris(4-sulfophenyl)phosphonium hydrogen sulphate: An efficient, eco-friendly and recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of coumarin derivatives via Pechmann condensation under solvent-free condition
Pechmann condensation of phenols with β-ketoesters in the presence of a novel ionic liquid bearing multi-SO3H groups under solvent-free conditions at ambient temperature gave the corresponding coumarin derivatives with excellent yields in shorter reaction times. This methodology is very simple, cost-effective, eco-friendly and the catalyst could be easily recycled
