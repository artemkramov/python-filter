Antagonistic activity and antibiotic sensitivity of Lactic acid bacteria from fermented dairy products
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from different fermented dairy food and identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus brevis. The cell free supernatant of the selected Lactic acid bacteria were able to inhibit the growth of all organisms, used in this study (E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Proteus). The antibiotic sensitivity was investigated. The tested Lactic acid bacteria produced various antimicrobial compounds such as organic acid, Hydrogen peroxide and di-acetyl.
