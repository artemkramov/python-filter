Analytical study of temperature variation of some real binary liquid mixtures using khasare formulation
We have used Khasare's formalism, to compute thermodynamic behaviour of structurally related real fluid mixtures under consideration, in terms of, temperature variation within permissible limits for temperature for liquids. The code developed in C is extensively used for theoretical computations. The temperature is varied from 293.16 K to 318.16 K in equal steps of 5K. Effect of temperature change is studied for Geometric packing fraction ( and reduced depth of potential ( for equal concentration of each liquid component in mixtures. Excess Helmoltz Energy, Excess bulk energy, Excess adiabatic compressibility. Ultrasonic wave velocities are computed using Khasare EOS.
