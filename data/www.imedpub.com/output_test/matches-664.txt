Synthesis and Characterization of Organometallic Complexes of Thiocarbanilides and Substituted ThiocarbanilidesÃ¢ÂÂUsing Manganese (II) Chloride
Organo-metallic complexes of substituted thiocarbanilide-using manganese (II) chloride were prepared, those were:-(1) 3:3'- Dichlorothiocarbanilide.Manganese (II) chloride. (2) 3:3'- dimethyl thiocarbanilide.Manganese(II)chloridee. (3) 2:2'- dimethyl thiocarbanilide.Manganese (II) chloride. Those compounds were colored, soluble in most organic solvents, insoluble in water, decomposed by hot solvents. The compounds (2) and (3) were spectrally characterized using UV and IR spectra, while the compound (1) was characterized by UV, IR, NMR and mass spectra. The molecular weight of the compound (1) was determined by three different methods; Rast's camphor method, mass spectra and the nitrogen contents. The stoichiometry of the reaction was found to be 2:1, and the coordination is from sulphur atom more than nitrogen.
