Monitoring of indoor radon and its progeny in dwellings of Delhi using SSNTDs
The study of radon and its progeny in dwellings is important as exposure to radon (222 Rn) can result in to a significant inhalation risk to population particularly to those living in homes. Radon and its radioactive daughters present in the environment results into the largest contribution to the average effective natural radiation dose received by human beings. In the present study, the indoor radon activity has been calculated using LR-115 type II solid state nuclear tracks detectors (SSNTDs). The radon activity in the corresponding dwellings has been found to vary from (43.5 ± 12.0) to (334.7 ± 33.5) Bqm-3 with an average value (166.9 ± 23.0) Bqm-3 . The annual effective dose received due to radon and its progeny by the inhabitants in the dwellings under study has also been calculated which found to vary from (1.5 ± 0.4) to (11.3 ± 1.1) mSv y-1 with an average value of (5.6 ± 0.8) mSv y-1.
