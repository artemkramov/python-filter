Mathematical models for predicting pollutants movement through porous rocks
Owing to the careless siting of human activities in Anambra State, resultant pollutants pass through porous rocks to pollute the underlying groundwater. Consequently, an infiltrometer was used to investigate the velocities of pollutants (four fluids) through five sedimentary formations of varying lithological characteristics, with a view to constructing a mathematical model for predicting the movement of pollutants through the porous rocks in the area. A purposive/judgmental sampling technique was used to select the formations used. Consequently, two mathematical equations useable to predict travel times and travel distances of pollutants were constructed so as to safeguard the groundwater resources of the area. The study recommended that in the planning and management of the physical environment of the state, knowledge of pollutants’ vertical velocity through porous rocks should be integrated into water resources management. This is to say that shale terrains or any other formations that have, at most, porosity and hydraulic conductivity values of 18% and 2.3 x 10-8 cm/sec. respectively, should be used for such activities. It also recommended that site selection for such anthropogenic activities should be based, among other things, on the knowledge of underlying geology of the place in question, and not merely on the availability of such space and close proximity to users. Further research areas were also recommended
