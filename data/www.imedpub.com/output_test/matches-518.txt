Current status of antibiotic resistant nonfermentative gram negative bacilli among nosocomial infections
Nonfermentative gram negative bacilli (NFGNB) are considered as a major contaminants in hospital environment but now it make a threat alarm of emerging an healthcare associated infections. Most of the isolates of NFGNB are highly resistant to major antibiotics including carbapenes and beta lactum antibiotics. Prevalence and considering this possibilities, the present study interpreted NFGNB from clinical specimens. Batteries of 121 clinical specimens were included. All the specimens were identified by the classical Microbiological and Biochemical tests. The result showed that 64(43.%) isolates among 149 specimens supported Pseudomonas spp. followed by acenetobacter spp. 32(21%) and 55(36%) recognised as Sphingomonas. The antibiotic sensitivity assay showed 80% of resistance to major antibiotics included. Due to multi resistance observation of the isolates, its is found by more NFGNB constant survey of antibiotic sensitivity is essential to control and management of nosocomial infections
