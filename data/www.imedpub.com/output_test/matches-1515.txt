Inhabitants believe on quack grounds for reemergence of viral hepatitis cases in Lakhimpur district of Assam
Viral hepatitis becomes a common problem among the community of Assam due to lack of sufficient knowledge regarding safe drinking water and hygiene. An outbreak of hepatitis A virus took place in Kopakchapori village under Boginodi block in lakhimpur district during the month of October, 2013. Blood samples were collected from suspected viral hepatitis patients to determine the aetiological agent of hepatitis virus. 57.14% of the collected samples confirmed HAV IgM Elisa positive. No HEV IgM positive cases were detected. Some typhoid positive patients were also detected in the locality, but no co-infection found. The patients were treated locally by some quack with the use of some herbal thread and herbal bindi (Tikka). Water samples collected from drinking water sources showed presence of higher level of bacilli which is not suitable for domestic purpose. Many unprotected tube wells were observed without brim or platform in all the houses of the locality. Observed poor hygiene as there is no latrine and the people having habit of open air defecation. Water sources used by the community were not only contaminated with HAV but also salmonella species. There is an enormous need to save the community in the Kopakchapori locality for future reinfection by giving awareness camp and adequate action from Public health engineering department.
