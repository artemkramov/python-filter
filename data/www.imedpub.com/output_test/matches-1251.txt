Diversity of sand dune fungi in the coastal areas of Puducherry and Karaikal region
Sand dune soil of seven different coastal areas of Puducherry and Karaikal were collected. The soil mycoflora were analyzed by serial dilution method by implementing SDA agar plates. A total number of 29 species representing 15 genera were isolated and identified from all the sand dune soils. Physicochemical analysis of the sand dune soil was carried out in which, pH was found between 7.2 to 8.2, EC between 0.5 to 1.9, available nitrogen between 20 to 60mg/g, available phosphorus between 0.14 to 0.51mg/g, available potassium between 1020 to 3050mg/g and micronutrients such as copper,zinc, manganese, iron were recorded at different concentrations. Similarity coefficient of fungal diversity was found significant, but the frequency and occurrence of mycoflora of each soil were varied at some extent. The greatest similarity in soil fungi occurred between S3 and S6 (83.8%), followed by S1 and S3 (76.4%) and S1 and S6 (74.2%)
