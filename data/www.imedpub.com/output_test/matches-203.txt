Groundmagnetic survey to investigate on the fault pattern of industrial estate Ogbomoso, Southwestern Nigeria
Groundmagnetic method was used to investigate on the fault pattern of industrial estate Ogbomoso which falls within latitude 080 06′ 07.4″ and 080 06′ 25.4″ and longitude 0040 15′ 03.3″ and 0040 15′ 49.0″ Southwestern Nigeria, with a view to determining the competency of the basement. This is to know whether the basement will be competent enough to withstand the construction of the factories in the study area or not. A total of four traverses were established for the purpose of the groundmagnetic study, and the results were presented as groundmagnetic profiles of varying magnetic intensities. Result from first vertical derivative revealed that the intensities and characteristics nature of the magnetic anomalies as expressed by all profiles are indicative of the different rock types producing them. Qualitative and quantitative interpretation of individual magnetic anomaly and geological knowledge of the survey area yielded information on the depth of geological features (e.g. rock contact, faults or fractures), structures and magnetic properties of rock units. From the preliminary interpretation, the existence of some structural features such as a likely fault and relatively mineralized zones that might contain magnetic minerals of essential magnetite origin is revealed. It was also revealed that industrial estate Ogbomoso is averagely competent for engineering purpose.
