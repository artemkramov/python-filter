Secured and authenticated transmission of data using multipath routing in mobile AD-HOC networks
Non-infrastructure networks are most commonly called as Mobile Ad hoc networks (MANETs). Unavailability of infrastructure or complexity and expensiveness of setting up the infrastructure results in the need of MANETs. MANETs can also be used when a network is to be setup quickly. The most important and complex problems in this kind of applications are routing, security and key management. The fundamental problem is how to deliver the data packets among nodes confidentially and efficiently without a predetermined topology or centralized control in the unsecured MANET. In this paper, we have given a notion to transmit the data through multipaths between nodes in ad hoc network to enhance the robustness of data confidentiality by secure authentication using digital signature concept.
