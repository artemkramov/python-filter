Analysis of Fluoride fluctuations in groundwater samples of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in and around Suryapet, Nalgonda district, Telangana, India
Groundwater is the real hotspot for different purposes in many parts of the world. Presence of low or high convergence of specific chemical compounds is a noteworthy issue, as they make the groundwater unacceptable for different purposes. Fluoride grouping of at least 0.6 mg/l is required for human utilization as it is the minimum required amount for proper nourishment of teeth and bones. Utilization of water with fluoride fixation above 1.5 mg/l results in intense to chronic dental fluorosis, where the teeth become hued from yellow to chestnut. Vicinity of low or high centralization of fluoride in groundwater is a direct result of regular or anthropogenic causes or a mix of both. Natural sources are related to the topographical states of a territory. A few rocks have fluoride bearing minerals like apatite, fluorite, biotite and hornblende. The weathering of these stones and infiltration of precipitation through it increases fluoride levels in groundwater. In the present study, it is observed that groundwater samples collected from Nemmikal and yarkaram villages contained fluoride more than acceptable limit. Spatial distribution maps of fluoride and location maps are generated by using Geographical Information System (GIS) software 9.3 version and fluoride fluctuation graph prepared for analysis.
