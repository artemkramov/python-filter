Biochemical composition of three Potamidid snails-Telescopium telescopium, Cerithidea cingulate and C. obtusa of Tekkali Creek (Bhavanapadu Mangroves), Andhra Pradesh, India
Carbohydrates, proteins and lipids were estimated in three species gastropod, Telescopium telescopium, Cerithidea cingulata and C. obtusa at Tekkali creek. Carbohydrates were 0.80 % in T. telescopium, 0.58 % in C. cingulata and 0.84 % in C. obtusa. The proteins were 21.01%, 13.08 % and 20.38% in T. telescopium, C. cingulate and C. obtusa respectively. Lipids were 18.9 %, 16.57 % and 19.5% in the respective three species. Albumin proteins were assayed with water and with KCl at different molarity i.e., 0.1M, 0.2M, 0.3M, 0.4M and 0.5 M and the values showed an increasing trend with increasing salt concentration, ranging from 0.01 % to 2.07 %.
