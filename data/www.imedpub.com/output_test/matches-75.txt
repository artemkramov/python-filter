Numerical study of MHD free convection heat and mass transfer from vertical surfaces in porous media considering Soret and Dufour effects
In the present approach, a two dimensional steady MHD free convection flow of heat and mass transfer from a vertical surface in porous media has been analyzed numerically consider with Soret and Dufour effects. The governing non linear partial differential equations have been transformed by a similar transformation in to a system of ordinary differential equations, which are solved numerically by using implicit finite difference scheme. The dimensionless velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are displayed graphically showing the effects for the different values of the Lewis number, soret number and Magnetic number.
