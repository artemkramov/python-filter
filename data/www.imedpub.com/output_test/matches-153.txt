Synthesis and characterisation of zeolite a for adsorption refrigeration application
The use of Kankara (Nigeria) kaolin as an alternative cheap raw material for the synthesis of Zeolite 4A for solar adsorption refrigeration application in developing countries especially Africa, using microwave oven was carried out by hydrothermal treatment of metakaolin with aqueous alkali Sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The study highlighted the preparation of Zeolite from metakaolin of quality Kankara kaolin and their characterization by XRF, XRD and FTIR spectrometer. The morphology was examined using SEM. Thermal analysis was followed by performing a TGA/DTA. Similar analysis was performed on the commercial Zeolite 4A sample thus confirming the production of Zeolite A with relative percentage of quartz.
