The design and production of a solar powered Zeolite-water adsorption refrigerator using concentrating parabolic collector (CPC) was done. An array of two CPCs with a total collector area of 1.029m2, concentration ratio of 1.8, height – aperture ratio of 1.19 with diameter 42mm cylindrical adsorber was designed, constructed and performance tested using commercial pelletised Zeolite 4A as adsorbent and water as refrigerant. The experimental results are presented in terms of values of system temperature and cooling performance coefficient. Measured hourly instantaneous COP ranges from 0.2 to 2.5 while the hourly insolation ranges from 34W/m2 to 345W/m2. Evaporator temperature of 11oC and maximum adsorber temperature of 110oC was recorded. The minimum daily – hourly mean COP of 0.838 with the corresponding maximum COP value of 1.48 was achieved. Meteorological condition was also recorded with an average total daily-hourly insolation of 170W/m2.
