Growth and characterization of L-cystine dihydrochloride single crystal
L-cystine dihydrochloride (LCDHCL) of dimension 6 x 4 x 3 mm3 was grown from aqua solution. The cell dimensions were obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. FT-IR, UV-vis-NIR and fluorescence spectral analyses were carried out for the grown crystals. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses were carried out to determine the thermal properties of the grown crystal. Kurtz powder second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency measurement revealed that the SHG efficiency is about ~6.72 times that of potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate
