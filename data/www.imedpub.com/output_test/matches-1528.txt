Trawl net by-catches off Visakhapatnam with special reference to Finfish
The study recorded eight groups of marine organisms namely coelenterates, shrimps, crabs, stomatopods, gastropods, cephalopods, echinodermates and finfish in the trawl net by-catch landings at Visakhapatnam fishing harbor. Among eight groups finfish, crabs, shrimps and stomatopods were dominant. Seasonal density distribution based on number percentage revealed that the group finfish contributed significantly to the by-catches during postmonsoon season 2006-07 (56.58%), 2007-08 (38.88%) and summer 2006-07 (35.05%). Crabs were more dominant group during monsoon 2006 (46.24%) and 2007 (47.94%). Season wise density distribution based on weight percentage finfish was the most dominant group in almost all seasons except monsoon 2007, where crabs (33.04%) were dominant. The density distribution of group finfish was represented by 38 families. Among 38 families, leiognathidae was most dominant family. The study recorded 67 species of finfish belonging to 51 genera. Among 67 species, Photopectoralis bindus was the most dominant species based on number percentage, while Uranoscopus archionema was the dominant species based on weight percentage.
