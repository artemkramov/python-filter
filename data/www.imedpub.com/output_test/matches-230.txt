Adsorption Studies on Alum sludge
Sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas is colourless with a pungent smell and is efficiently absorbed in upper respiratory tract. Lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, cough, bronchial secretion and bronchoconstriction occur at high concentrations of SO2. The combustion of fossil fuels and power generation is a major source of SO2 gas in the environment. The present study deals with the experimental investigations carried out for controlling SO2 gas by alum sludge. It was found that the amount of gas adsorbed by alum sludge is 100% at low concentrations and 89% at high concentrations. The experiments are conducted with respect to contact time, with respect to particle size, with respect to initial concentration of SO2, and with respect to alum sludge dosages.
