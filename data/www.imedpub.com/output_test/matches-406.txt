Isolation identification and distribution of bacteria in Dairy Effluent
This research work determined the bacteriological characteristics of the dairy effluent. Bacteriological studies were carried out from 2008 at fourstation. Totally 18 bacteria were isolated. Alcaligenes faecalis, Lueconostoc lactis,was predominant in other species. Out of this species Alcaligenes faecalis had most abundant followed by Lueconostoc, lactobacillus was higher number of species were obtained in summer season. Results of one year ecological study revealed that altogether species of bacteria from 18 genera were isolated from the records. Among the bacteria Alcaligens faecalis was dominant in dairy effluent and in all the four seasons. The dominant genus followed by Lacto bacillus,lueconostoclactis. The abundance of Alcaligenes faecalis in dairy effluent has due to favorable content of oxidizable organic matter, rich calcium, magnesium and abundance nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, sulphates content of less dissolved oxygen and alkaline pH. The utilization of dominant species of Alcaligens faecalis to monitor pollution in dairy effluent has also been recorded.
