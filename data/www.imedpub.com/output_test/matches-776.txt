Evaluation of microorganisms associated with vaginal infections in Owo, Nigeria
This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms associated with vaginitis among women of reproductive age in Owo, Nigeria and its environment. Sixty five women visiting the gynaecology unit of the Federal Medical Centre Owo were recruited for this study between December 2010 and May 2011. High vaginal swabs were obtained from the subjects following informed consent with the assistance of the consultants. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, S. cohnii, S. massiliensis, Micrococcus lylae, Luteococcus sanguinis, Brevibacterium epidermidis, Burkholderia cepacia, Fransciella philomiragia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, OFBA-1, Bacillus megaterium, Citrobacterfreundii, Citrobacter spp. and Escherichia coli. Candida albicans was isolated from 17% of the subjects along with bacteria. Organisms isolated from cases of pelvic inflammatory diseases are S. aureus, S. cohnii, Bacillus megaterium, Brevibacterium epidermidis, Franciella philomiragia, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Candida albicans. Isolates from patients with infertility include Brevibacterium epidermidis, S. aureus, Luteococcus sanguinis, Citrobacter freundii, OFBA-1 organism, Micrococcus lylae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Candida albicans. Burkholderia cepacia and S. aureus were isolated from cases of delay and infrequent menstruation. Organisms isolated from pregnant women were S. aureus, S. cohnii and L. sanguinis. Isolated bacteria gave varied resistant patterns to the antibiotics tested. The Gram-positive organisms were more resistant to the combination of ampicillin/cloxacillin with 21.74% susceptibility, while the Gram-negative organisms were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and streptomycin (91.67% each). Resistance to multiple drugs were reported among the bacterial isolates
