Effect of various antioxidants on solvent extracted Indian Mackerel (Rastrelliger Kanagurta) fish oil
This paper presents a study on the extraction of Mackerel fish oil of Indian origin and to investigate the extent of oxidation of mackerel fish oil with added antioxidants. Production and characterization of Mackerel fish oil was carried out using Soxhlet apparatus and n-Hexane as the solvent for extraction. The extraction was carried out at the boiling point of the solvent. Antioxidant property was simulated by storing the fish oil at 4°C and 25Ã¢ÂÂ°C. Four different antioxidants were used to evaluate oxidation during storage. The stability of fish oil was evaluated by measuring the peroxide value and the anisidine value. Little changes were observed in the peroxide values of the fish oil during the initial 7days.Addition of BHT and Citric acid had no significance for retarding autoxidation of the fish oil at both storage conditions. TBHQ and BHA gave good antioxidants effect for fish oil stored at 4Ã¢ÂÂ°C and 25Ã¢ÂÂ°C. They were effective to reduce the formation of peroxides in Fish oil. There was very little secondary oxidation of fish oil and no significant effects of all four antioxidants on changes of anisidine values during the storage period
