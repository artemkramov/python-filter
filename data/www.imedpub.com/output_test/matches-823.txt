Influence of Zn(II) Doping on the Structural and Optical Properties of Gel Grown Lead Iodate Crystals
In this research, the growth of the zinc doped lead iodate crystals is reported. The crystals were grown in silica gel medium by single diffusion technique. It was observed that, size of the crystals increased with increasing the doping concentration of Zn2+. The influence of doping of transition metal Zn on lead iodate crystals has been studied using XRD and UV-Vis. XRD analysis reveals that average grain size of the crystal decreased with increasing the doping concentration of Zn2+ ions. The study of UV absorption spectra reveals that value of band gap energy increased slightly as the concentration of zinc increased.
