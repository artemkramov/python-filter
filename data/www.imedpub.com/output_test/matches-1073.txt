Effect of using extruded linseed on colostrum production, composition, some blood parameters and overall health in Holstein dairy cows
This study was for investigating to the effect of dietary supplementation of extruded linseed on colostrum production, colostrum composition and some blood parameters of Holstein calves. The Average of lactation period of 20 transition cows was same. They were divided in two groups. First group was control and the second group was treatment. Diets were designed have similar composition of protein and energy. Experimental diet was including based diet in addition of 500 g/kg DM extruded linseed per head and control diet group was including based diet without extruded linseed. After calving each cow colostrum samples were obtained, also blood samples were gathering in day of birth (d 0), 7 and 14 days after birth. Data were analyzed by GLM proc. Data showed that the colostrum production was higher in treatment group (6.85L) than control group (5.66L), Fat, Lactose, protein and SNF were greater in control group, and also SCC was greater in control group due to mastitis. Cows fed extruded linseed had difference results in blood parameters, but there was not any significant between blood parameters in groups. Vitamin A (Vit A) was greater in d 0 (4.12 mg/dl) and d 7 (9.21mg/dl) after birth, Vit E was greater on d 7 (0.82 mg/dl), and Vit D was higher just in day of birth (33.2 mg/dl) in treatment group. Cows fed extruded linseed had higher IgM than IgG. Also IgG was higher in d 0 (8.57 g/ml) and d 7 (9.20 g/ml) after birth and IgG was greater in d 14 (9.78 g/ml). Result of this study showed that using of extruded linseed could affect on colostrum production, composition, some blood parameters and overall health in Holstein dairy cows.
