Biotechnology: A migiating measure against food crises in Nigeria
It is a known fact that the right to adequate food and nutrition, to be free from hunger or the right to feed oneself is a fundamental human right firmly established is the international law, it is also undoubted that there is food crisis in Nigeria, therefore in an attempt to overcome the challenges of satisfying the food needs of the citizenry, successive governments have introduced a number of programmes and policies such as green revolution, back to the land, agricultural development projects and so on, to alleviate food insecurity in the country. It is lamentable however, that as laudable as these programmes were, the nation had continued to depend on proof importation to feed here ever teeming population. Biotechnology which in general terms refers to the application of wide range of scientific technique for the modification and improvement of plants and animals and micro-organisms no doubt a mitigating measure against food crises in Nigeria. It is sustainable, cost effective and convenient because it can be used to reduce the need for herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers. The recent advent of genetic engineering and recombinant DNA techniques have really boosted the biotechnological advancements exploited primarily for industrial and public needs. However, the government is expected to come up with clear cut regulatory guidelines on biotechnology. This paper therefore, highlights the cause of food crises in Nigeria and the essence of biotechnology as a mitigating measure of food crises. It is envisaged that appropriate adoption of the various opportunities which biotechnology offers would ensure food security and improve standard of living of the citizenry.
