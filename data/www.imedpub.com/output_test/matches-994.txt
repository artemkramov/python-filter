The introduction of combined therapy has been an important breakthrough in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, however for proper eradication, HIV pathogenesis has to be understood. Despite treatment with combinatorial therapies, a functional cure approach would be very effective in suppressing viraemic load in the host to such low levels that the immune system would be able to control the infection without the need for antiretroviral therapy, neither inflicting harm upon the host nor transmission to other individuals. Scientific focus should be on proper approach, that is direct functional cure, which provides present and future possible treatment strategies to completely eradicate HIV persistence in the reservoirs within the host through full understanding of the mechanism behind HIV pathogenesis. However, for proper eradication of HIV in infected individuals, there should be a better understanding of the immunologic and virologic mechanisms that contribute to viral persistence in infected individuals. The full understanding of HIV pathogenesis is the only scientific way by which its eradication will be fully accomplished
