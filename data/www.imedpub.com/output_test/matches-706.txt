Cloud Computing: Solution to ICT in Higher Education in Nigeria
Information and communication technologies (ICT) have become commonplace entities in all aspects of life. Across the past twenty years the use of ICT has fundamentally changed the practices and procedures of nearly all forms of endeavour within business and governance. Within education, ICT has begun to have a presence but the value of ICT is not affordable. Unfortunately, there are some limitations confronting institutions in Nigeria from infusing ICT. The basic principle of cloud computing entails the reduction of in-house data centres and the delegation of a portion or all of the Information Technology infrastructure capability to a third party. This holds the promise of driving down cost while fostering innovation and promoting agility. Institutions of higher learning, such as Universities and Colleges, are the core of innovation through their advanced research and development. Subsequently, Higher Institutions may benefit greatly by harnessing the power of cloud computing, including cost cutting as well as all the above types of cloud services. This paper explores the application of cloud computing in higher education in Nigeria, issues with ICT in Nigeria and touches upon some aspired benefits as well as expected limitations of cloud computing.
