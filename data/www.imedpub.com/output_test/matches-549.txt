Immune status of HIV/AIDS patients with hepatitis B virus in Benue State, Nigeria
The CD4 counts of HIV positive individuals with hepatitis B surface antigen was a factor used to determine the immune status among infected individuals in Benue State. Of 966 males infected with HIV, 15(1.55%) were positive for HBsAg+ with CD4 counts &lt;335 cell/μl and in the female category, 10(0.95%) of 1042 were positive for HBsAg+ with the CD4+ counts &lt;420 at the initial CD4 cells counts. According to age, individuals aged between 30 and 39 years were positive for HBsAg+ with their CD4 counts ≤335 cell/μl. The least in terms of HBsAg+ carriage (0.34%) were those 50 years and above whose CD4 read &lt;224 cell/μl. After an interval of 6 months, the CD4 level declined to &lt;100 cell/μl. However, there was a significant relationship in the degree of infection among sexes (Z=0.40&lt;±1.96). HBsAg+ carriage rate was dependent on age (x²=7.82&lt;0.05).
