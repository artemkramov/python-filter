Morphometric studies on wild caught and cultured shrimp Penaeus monodon (Fabricius, 1798) from Parangipettai, India
A study was carried out in a commercial shrimp farm situated on the Northern banks of Vellar estuary (Lat. 110 29’ N; Long. 790 46’ E). Total of 700 cultured shrimps and 400 shrimps of wild males and females Penaeus monodon were collected and studied relationship between the 15 morphometric measurements. In wild males, PTL X FSL, PCL X FiSL, CD X FSL and CD X SSL combinations showed positive allometric growth relationship. Combination of PTL X SSL, PCL X FSL, PCL X SSL and CD X TSL, showed isometric growth. In cultured males, PTL X PCL, PTL X CW, PTL X CD, PTL X FSL, PTL X SSL, PTL X TSL, PTL X FoSL, PTL X FiSL, PTL X AAC and SSD X AAC showed positive allometry. PTL X SSD, PCL X SSL, CD X SSL, FSL X SSL and FSL X TSL showed isometric. In wild females, PTL X CW, PTL X CD, PTL X FSL, PTL X SSL, PTL X TSL, PTL X AAC, and PTL X PAC showed positive allometric and combinations of PTL X PCL, PCL X FSL, showed isometric. In cultured females, PTL X PCL, PTL X CD, PTL X FSL, PTL X SSL, PTL X TSL, PTL X FoSL, PTL X SiSL, PTL X AAC, PCL X TSL, FSL X TSL and SSL X TSL combinations showed positive allometric. PTL X CW, PTL X PAC, PCL X CD and PCL X SSL showed isometric and the remaining combinations showed negative allometric growth relationships. Important of this work is essential in stock assessment from wild and exploitation.
