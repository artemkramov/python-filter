Effects of chemical reaction on mhd free convective oscillatory flow past a porous plate with viscous dissipation and heat sink
An attempt has been made to study the two-dimensional MHD free convective oscillatory flow of an electrically conducting incompressible viscous fluid past an infinite vertical porous plate, through which suction occurs with constant velocity and chemical reaction in the presence of a heat sink. A uniform magnetic field is assumed to be applied transversely to the direction of the free stream taking into account of induced magnetic field. The governing equations involved in the present analysis are solved by using the perturbation method. The velocity, temperature and concentration fields are studied for different parameters such as Grashof number, modified Grashof number, Magnetic field parameter, Schmidt number, Prandtl number, heat sink parameter and Chemical reaction parameter, Eckert number etc.
