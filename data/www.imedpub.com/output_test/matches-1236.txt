Length-weight relationship of Mugil cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Bandar Abbas Port and Qeshm Island in northeastern Persian Gulf
The length-weight relationship was derived for Mugil cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Bandar Abbas Port and Qeshm Island in northeastern Persian Gulf. A total of 71 adult individuals of the M.cephalus were collected by stake-net and preserved in 4% formalin. Total length and weight ranged from 16.1 to 32.6 cm and 102.8 to 487.9 g, respectively. The Length-weight (LWR) was determined according to the power regression model. The relationship between total length and weight was described for M. cephalus in Bandar Abbas Port W= 0.0234L2.9118 (R2 = 0.9657) and in Qeshm Island W= 0.0277L2.9018 (R2 = 0.9412)
