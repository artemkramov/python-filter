Dynamics of landuse and landcover changes in Papanasam Taluk, Thanjavur District, Tamilnadu, India
Remote sensing has been in common use to provide the primary data from which land use and land cover types and their boundaries are for interpretation purpose. During the past four decades several surveys, studies, and other projects have successfully demonstrated that remote sensing data are useful for land use and land cover inventory and mapping. These surveys have contributed to our confidence that land use and land cover surveys of larger areas are possible by the use of remote sensing data bases. It has been argued in this paper that a systematic analysis of local-scale land-use change studies, conducted over a range of timescale. Over the last few decades, numerous researchers have improved measurements of land-cover change, the understanding of the causes of land-use change.
