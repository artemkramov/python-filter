The effect of hybridization on the area and number of leaves in some important genotypes of Saintpaulia ionantha
"Saintpaulia ioantha H. wendele" known as African Violet is a potted plant and it belongs to Gesneriaccea family. For this plant’s great popularity, having various kinds of leaves and different colorful flowers, they have great potential in breeding examinations on them. So, in this study 4 genotypes of African Violets had been analyzed. The characteristics had been studied, included flower color, flower type, leaf form, fuzz of leaf, peduncle size and inflorescence. This test had been performed in an absolute random design with 3 repetitions and 5 flower pots, as examinational units. First of all, operation of multilation had been done by anthers cut off at full bloom time .By the next week ovary was growing and maturing around 6 months long. The result of these crosses showed that none of the A×D, A×C, A×B and A×A crosses were able to produce any seeds. Also there were no seeds in B×A cross while in D×B, B×C, B×B crosses we could gain seeds. The results of the mean comparison showed, line D (magenta) and A (violet blue), respectively, the highest and lowest Leaf number. Also it showed that leaf area the line B (blue-violet) with an average of 57.39 cm2 are maximum and Line C (purple), average 34.50 cm2 are minimum
