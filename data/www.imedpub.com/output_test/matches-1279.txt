Studies on Qualitative and Quantitative Phytochemical Analysis of Cissus quadrangularis
Plants have served human beings as a natural source for treatments and therapies from ancient times, amongst them medicinal herbs have gain attention because of its wide use and less side effects. In the recent years plant research has increased throughout the world and a huge amount of evidences have been collected to show immense potential of medicinal plants used in various traditional systems, thus in the present investigation the phytochemical analysis of Cissus quadrangularis was carried out as these plants have been proved to be one of the important medicine for treatment of bone fractures. The phytochemical analysis was carried out for the different parts of the plant extracted with methanol and ethanol solvents. The qualitative analysis showed that alkaloids were mainly seen in most of the samples except methanolic extract of stem and fruit. Tannins, proteins, carbohydrate and phenol were present in all the 4 samples extracted by both methanol and ethanol. Flavonoids were seen only in leaf samples where as cardiac glycosides were seen only in stem samples extracted with methanol. Saponins were mainly present in the samples extracted from methanolic solvent. The qualitative analysis carried out for the determination of phenols, carbohydrates, tannins, alkaloids and proteins. Tannins were seen mainly in leaf samples of both the extracts, ethanol extract of the fruit shown the maximum amount of phenol and proteins. The leaf samples extracted by the solvents possessed contained high carbohydrate content. The presence of high amount of phytochemical compounds suggest that the Cissus quadrangularis plant has higher medicinal value and can be extensively studied to extract the natural compounds which are beneficial to human beings and that could be commercialized for higher production than using synthetic drugs with side effects.
