CarlsonÃ¢ÂÂs Trophic State Index for the assessment of trophic status of two Lakes in Mandya district
Carlson’s Trophic State Index(CTSI) was applied to two lakes of Mandya. This index requires the determination only three physic chemical variables viz., Chlorophylla(CA), total phosphorus(TP) and Secchi disc depth transparency. The index values ranging from 0 to 100 and can be used for classification of trophic state of the lakes. The results of the study showed that the values of CTSI of these lakes ranged between35-53 indicating that they are mesotrophic. Periodic removal of algal mass and macrophytes may be helpful for minimize pollution and conservation of these still water ecosystems.
