On Some Polynomial-time Algorithms for Solving Linear Programming Problems
In this article we survey some Polynomial-time Algorithms for Solving Linear Programming Problems namely: the ellipsoid method, Karmarkar’s algorithm and the affine scaling algorithm. Finally, we considered a test problem which we solved with the methods where applicable and conclusions drawn from the results so obtained.
