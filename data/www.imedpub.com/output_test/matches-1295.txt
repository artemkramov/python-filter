Unsteady MHD pulsatile flow of couple stress fluid under the influence of periodic body acceleration between two parallel plates
In this paper, we discuss an analytical study of unsteady hydro magnetic generalized couette flow of an incompressible electrically conducting couple stress fluid between two parallel plates, taking into account pulsation of the pressure gradient effect and under the influence of periodic body acceleration with phase differencef . The solution of the problem is obtained with the help of perturbation technique. Analytical expression is given for the velocity and the effects of the various governing parameters entering into the problem are discussed with the help of graphs. The shear stresses on the boundaries are also obtained analytically and their behaviour computationally discussed with different variations in the governing parameters in detail.
