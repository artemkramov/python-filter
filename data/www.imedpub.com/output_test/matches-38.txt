Determination of polyalcohols by Smith degradation technique from Withania somnifera Dunal seeds oxo-polysaccharide
Water soluble seeds polysaccharide were extracted from Withania somnifera Dunal as D-glucose and D-mannose in 1:3 molar ratio by GLC, column and paper chromatography. Periodate oxidized seeds polysaccharide was degraded with sodium borohydride followed by sulphuric acid with Smith degradation method. Hydrolysate yielded polyalcohols as glycerol and erythritol in 1:54:4.26 molar ratio with traces of thritol on paper chromatogram. Derivatives of polyalcohols were produced as glycerol-tri-O-p-nitrobenzoate and tetra-O-tosyl-erythritol. Absorbance of polyalcohols were recorded on 540 mμ in photoelectrocolorimeter. The earlier proposed seeds polysaccharide structure of Withania somnifera Dunal plant has been tentatively confirmed on the basis of above finding results
