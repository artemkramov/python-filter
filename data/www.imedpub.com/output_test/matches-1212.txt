Synthesis, characterization of some transition metal complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate schiff base
Neutral tetradentate complexes of Cr(III), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) have been synthesized using a unsymmetrical Schiff base formed by the condensation of Dehydroacetic acid, 3-nitrobenzaldehyde and 6-methyl- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (L) in alcohol medium. All the complexes were characterized on the basis of their micro analytical data, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR,UV-Vis, 1H NMR, X-ray diffraction, therogravimetric analysis. The ligand and its complexes were screened for their antibacterial activity against bacterium Staphylococcus aurious, B.subtilis (Gram positive) and Escherichia coli, K.pneumonae (Gram negative). The result indicated that the complexes exhibited good antibacterial activities
