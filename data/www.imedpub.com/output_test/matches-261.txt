Removal and decolorization of dye bearing textile effluents by sulfinated furfural-acetone resin
In this study, we aimed to investigate the removal and decolorization of dye bearing textile effluents by sulfinated furfural-acetone (SFA) resin. Various textile effluents were collected and treated with various mixtures of SFA resin, rice husk and animal charcoal. The resultant liquids were almost colorless with very low COD. The sludge can also be used for pigmentation as well as filler for plastic manufacturing. The produced polymers may have entity in environmental science. This sulfinated resin was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The adsorption properties of this resin were investigated under different adsorption conditions with different initial dye concentrations, contact times, and pH values. The adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed with Langmuir and Freundlich models. The adsorption behaviors of various textile effluents onto the SFA- resin were better described by the Freundlich model.
