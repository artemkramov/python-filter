Growth of cultured white Leg Shrimp Litopenaeus Vannamei (Boone, 1931) of brackish water culture system in summer season with artificial diet
The Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931) is an Ecological important tropical and euryhaline species. The shrimp used semi-intensive culture system and taken 3ponds each one 0.7 ha and stocking densities (post larvae) each one (3, 50,000) 500 species/m2 for the study, survival was 86%, 88% and 90%. Crab fencing and bird netting was done before pumping water to prevent the auto entrants. In rainy seasons in month of March to August, the water quality parameters were measured fortnightly in a month at 7a.m. The artificial diet was provided 4times/day (6a.m; 11a.m; 4p.m and 9p.m) given made by Manamei feed pellets (Protein 35 and 34%). The production was 8337, 8932and 9450kg and FCR was1.78, 1.81 and 1.82 and mean growth was 27.7, 29.0 and 30.0g / 120, 123 and 126 days for P1, P2 and P3, respectively
