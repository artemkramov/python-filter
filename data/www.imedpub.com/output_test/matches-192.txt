Measurement of Anomalies in The Spatial Distribution of Radon Content of Soil Gas in some regions of Middle Shivaliks, India
In present study solid-state nuclear track detectors (LR-115 Type-II) ( from Kodak France) is in order to determine the soil gas radon profile in areas of middle shivaliks active fault systems in Jwalaji and Dehra region ,India “a well known seismic zone”.To study the radon anomalies of the region.Area under study divide into five profiles. Radon shows variation not only due to the tectonic structures but also due to change in lithology.Radon anomalies show that apart from conspicuous thrust MBT-2, the area under study is cut across by the N-S transverse faults/lineaments
