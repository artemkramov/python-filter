Gamma rays and EMS induced flower color and seed mutants in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp)
The present study was carried out to induce flower color and seed mutants in cowpea. Seeds were subjected to different treatment levels of gamma rays and ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS). The treated and untreated plants were self-fertilized for five generations to observe different morphological characters in M6 generation. Several unique and interesting mutants were isolated in this investigation. These independent mutants have different phenotypes from control. Highest mutation frequency for flower color and seed characteristics was induced by 25mM EMS. The most distinct mutants included were different flower color and altered size, shape and coat color of seeds were also observed.
