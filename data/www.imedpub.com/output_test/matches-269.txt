Antimicrobial activity of Naphthyl Iso-quinoline alkaloids of Ancistrocladus heyneanus: I Extracted from Leaves
Ancistrocladus heyneanus is a tropical liana plant. It is rich in Naphthyl Isoquinolin alkaloids. Antimicrobial activity of three Gram negative and one gram positive bacteria were tested against crude aqueous and organic solvent extracts of Ancistrocladus heyneanus stem; using agar well method. Later the alkaloids from crude organic solvent extract were isolated by HPTLC. Four distinct bands of alkaloids were observed. Each of them was tested for its antimicrobial activity. It was found that crude extracts showed activity against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria. Fraction 1 showed activity against only gram positive bacteria and not against any gram negative bacteria. Whereas, inhibition of growth of gram positive bacteria S. aureus was obviously more when H2 and H4 fractions of alkaloid were tested. Both crude extracts as well as isolated alkaloid fractions showed considerable activity against gram positive bacteria but not against gram negative bacteria.
