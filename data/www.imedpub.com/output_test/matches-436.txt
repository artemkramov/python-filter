Occurrence of chromium metal in Siddheshwar Reservoir at Hingoli, India
This research work aims to study the presence of chromium metal in water using UV-VIS spectrophotometer from Siddheshwar dam at Taluka Aundha of district Hingoli, Maharashtra state of India was studied during the study period of July 2009 to June 2010. This metal is estimated by Diphenylcarbazide method. Chromium, a heavy metal, is used in a variety of industrial applications. It is highly toxic to humans, animals, plants and microorganisms. Chromium is found in all natural waters both in hexavalent and trivalent forms. Oxidative form of chromium is very important relative to its mobility and its role in plant and human nutrition. The water was found to be contaminated with chromium when compared with their standard limits for drinking water prescribed by different organizations like World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Several changes occurred during the study period in chromium concentrations from selected sampling sites.
