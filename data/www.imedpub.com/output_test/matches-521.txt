Molecular Characterisation of Cryptosporidium Species from Extensively Managed Cattle Slaughtered inAbattoirs in Kaduna State, Nigeria
Cryptosporidium species are recognised as important cause of diarrhoea in both animal and man especially children, the aged and HIV infected individuals. This study examined the prevalence, distribution, genotypes and subgenotypes of Cryptosporidium implicated in animal cryptosporidiosis in Kaduna State. A total of 300 animal faecal samples were collected and analysed. All samples were screened by microscopy after modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining. Cryptosporidium-positive faecal samples were genotyped by nested PCR followed by RFLP. The samples were further subgenotyped by nested PCR and amplification of gp60 kDa gene and subsequent nucleotide sequencing. Prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in cattle was found to be 15.7% (47/300) as determined by microscopy. PCR-RFLP analysis of the 18S rRNA gene fragment revealed that three genotypes including Cryptosporidium bovis (57.1%), Cryptosporidium ryanae (14.3%) and Cryptosporidium parvum (28.6%) were identified in the samples. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gp60 kDa gene yielded subtype families IIa and IIdin Cryptosporidium parvum; these subtypes had equal occurrence with subgenotypes IIaA15G2R1 (100.0%) and IIdA15G1 (100.0%) respectively. This study showed that cryptosporidiosis is prevalent in the study population and the occurrence of IIa and IId subtype families suggests that zoonotic transmission is important and likely transmission route of cryptosporidiosis in the Kaduna State.
