Studies on Mycoremediation of used engine oil contaminated soil samples
The used engine oil contaminated soil samples were collected from various automobile workshops in Pudukkottai, Tamilnadu, South India. From the collected samples indigenous fungi were isolated using Malt extract medium. Totally sixteen isolates were isolated among which Aspergillus and Rhizopus sp were found to be predominant. The morphological and microscopical studies were done. Morphological studies of isolated fungal isolates showed different growth pattern on different media. Preliminary hydrocarbon degradation analyses were done to evaluate the growth diameter of fungal colonies on Minimal media supplement with used engine oil. Turbidity assay using Minimal medium was done to confirm the hydrocarbon degradation. The fungal isolates JJF3 and JF9 showed better results; hence they were selected for further analysis. The gravimetric analysis revealed that the both isolates degraded used engine oil 40.5% and 51.6% respectively at 30 days. The FT-IR spectrum of control and treated samples with fungal isolates revealed differences in band formation indicating microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons. When conditions such as pH requirement and nutrient availability are taken into consideration during a bioremediation project, the rate of microbial degradation could be conveniently achieved within a much shorter time than even what was obtained in this study. The rigours of bioaugumenting contaminated soils for the purpose of bioremediation can be avoided and effective remediation still achieved if suitable conditions that will enhance indigenous microbial activities for optimum degradation are satisfied.
