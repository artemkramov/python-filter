Metal-ligand stability constants of Fe (III), Cd( II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) metal ion complexes with Lorazepam in aquo-organic media at 0.1 M ionic strength pH metrically
The study of transition metal ion Fe (III), Cd( II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Lorazepam (7-chloro-5-(2- chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-1H- 1,4- benzodiazepin-2(3H)-one) as ligand have been studied at 0.1M ionic strength in 60% and 70% EtOH and MeOH water mixture by binary system in pH metry analysis. The data obtained were utilized for the evaluation of dissociation constant and stability constant and compare the valve of Proton ligand stability constant (pK) and Metal ligand stability constant (LogK). These data also used in the prediction of activation parameter Δ, Δ , Δ. 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-1H- 1,4- benzodiazepin-2(3H)-one
