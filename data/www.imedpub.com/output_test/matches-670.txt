An evaluation of the physical parameters of river Gongola in Adamawa State, Nigeria
The evaluation of the physical parameter levels of river Gongola was done using Digital Spectrophotometer 2010. It revealed high pH (7.23±0.44) to 7.60 ± 0.35during dry season and low pH (6.61± 0.01 to 7.35 ± 0.04) in the wet season. The temperatures ranged from 26.25±1.28oC to 27.36± 0.41oC in dry season and 20.21± 0.52oC to 21.77 ±1.38oC in wet season. The total hardness and total carbonate were almost the same for both seasons but they differ in the wet season. Conductivities were higher than the total dissolved solids (TDS). These values were found to be within the permissible limits of the WHO and NAFDAC.
