Radiation and chemical reaction effects on an unsteady MHD convection flow past a vertical moving porous plate embedded in a porous medium with viscous dissipation
The objective of this paper is to analyze the radiation and mass transfer effects on an unsteady two-dimensional laminar mixed convective boundary layer flow of a viscous, incompressible, electrically conducting chemically reacting fluid, along a vertical moving semi-infinite permeable plate with suction, embedded in a uniform porous medium, in the presence of transverse magnetic filed, by taking into account the effects of viscous dissipation. The equations of continuity, linear momentum, energy and diffusion, which govern the flow field, are solved by using a regular perturbation method. The behaviour of the velocity, temperature, concentration, skin-friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number has been discussed for variations in the governing parameters.
