Thermodynamic study of liquid with solver z &amp; suitable hmax as a pole in basic two parameter KhasareÃ¢ÂÂs equation of state
Author develops or built a simple condition for cluster formation/decay by considering the thermodynamics of molecules within an effective potential of mean force due to the cluster. Efforts are made to estimate cavity in fluid, using equation of state equation of State .The temperature dependence of structural properties and thermodynamic behavior of water clusters has been studied. Computations based on z as a solver predict the closeness of thermodynamic values. From the profile of the fluid the model results are discussed in terms of formation of cavity due to closed surface along with its associated energy. As per the expectation, for water it is observed that size of the cavity is rapidly decreased due to breaking of hydrogen bonds as the temperature of liquid increases. Present calculation is based upon the sample thermodynamic data such as ultrasonic wave, density, volume expansion coefficient and ratio of specific heat, and it's inter consistency with thermodynamic relations contain model parameter such as size and energy
