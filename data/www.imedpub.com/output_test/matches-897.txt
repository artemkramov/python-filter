Simulation of solar biomass hybrid dryer for drying cashew kernel
Cashew processing industries are mostly located in rural areas. Especially in and around cuddalore district, Tamilnadu, India, there are many industries using conventional methods for drying of cashew kernels without knowing the advance method of solar drying techniques. The solar dryer performance is mainly depending on the uniform distribution of temperature flow field inside the dryer. In this study a solar biomass hybrid dryer was constructed and experimentally tested without any trays and any load. The temperature distribution of air flow inside the dryer was performed with Solidworks 2014 SP4.0 .The experimental data’s was used for the boundary conditions. The simulation results show that the results might be acceptable when compared with the experimental value.
