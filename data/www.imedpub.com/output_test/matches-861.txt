Study of Wave Propagation through Thin Film: Analysis and assessment of dielectric function and refractive index
We present an analytical approach to study electromagnetic wave propagation through a dielectric thin film medium. We used theoretical solution of the scalar wave equation to analyze and assess the influence of dielectric function and refraction index on the propagating wave. Non-vectorial aspects of the propagating wave through the thin film resulting from the film orientation were considered and the computed field value, ψ propagating through the thin film with variation of the propagation distance was analyzed within the ultraviolet, visible and near of electromagnetic wave and the absorption of the propagated wave by the thin film manifested on the wave profile. The influence of the refractive index and the characteristic impedance offered by the thin film medium on the propagating wave was assessed
