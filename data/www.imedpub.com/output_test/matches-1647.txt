Ultrasonic study of hydrogen bonded complexes in benzene solution
Ultrasonic Velocity and density measurements are reported for H- Bonded complexes of n-Butylamine + ochlorophenol, n-Butylamine + p-chlorophenol, n-Propylamine + o-chlorophenol, n-Propylamine + p-chlorophenol, Trimethylamine + m-chlorophenol, Aniline + m-chlorophenol in benzene solution, at 2MHZ and at 313K. Various ultrasonic parameters, such as adiabatic compressibility (βa), Rao’s constant (R), Free Length (Lf), and available volume (Va) are reported. Using these parameters the strength of H- Bonded complex is compared
