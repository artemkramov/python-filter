In the present work, we have measured the specific activity and the radiation hazard indices in fifteensamples, which include five for solid sample and ten for Liquid samples from different locations inside Al-Dora refinery by usinga high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. For solid samples, the results have shown that the specific activity, for 238U ranged from(32.62±5.71 Bq/kg) in D4to(9.39±3Bq/kg) in D13, for 232Th was ranged from (26.56±5.15 Bq/kg) in D6 to (6.28±2.51Bq/kg) in D13, for 40K was ranged from (277.59±16.66 Bq/kg) in D6 to (51.22±7.16 Bq/kg) in D13, for 137Cs was ranged from(3.05±1.75 Bq/kg) in D6 to (B.D.L) in D13. In addition, for liquid samples, the specific activity, for 238U was ranged from (35.04±5.92 Bq/l) in D8to (1.59±1.26 Bq/l) in D11, for 232Th was ranged from (35.47±5.96 Bq/l) in D11 to (3.27±1.81Bq/l) in D14, for 40K was ranged from (422.28±20.55 Bq/l), in D15 to (14.16±3.76 Bq/l) in D10, for 137Cs was ranged from (11.16±3.34 Bq/l), in D10 to (1.17±1.08 Bq/l) in D3. But regarding the radiation hazard indices in (both solid and liquid) ,for Radium Equivalent Activity(Raeq) was ranged between (5.21-79.84Bq/kg,Bq/l),for Absorbed Gamma Dose Rate (Dγ) was ranged between (37.53- 2.49)nGy⁄h, for indoor (AEDE) ranged from (0.012-0.184)and for outdoor (AEDE) ranged from(0.003-0.046)in mSv/y, for internal hazard index (Hin) ranged from (0.025-0.079) and for external hazard index(Hex)ranged from(0.014-0.216),respectively. The present results show that specific activity and the radiation hazard indices in all samples are less than the recommended by the worldwide average. Therefore, the study shows that all the studied sites in Al-Dora refinery do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard and are safe for use.
