Electromagnetic field frequency memory in water as revealed by germination responses of fungal spores
Electromagnetic field frequency memory in water was verified by recording the germination responses of different fungal spores. There is sufficient evidence that water exposed to electromagnetic (EM) field undergoes structural changes and the water remembers the field memory for extended period of time as discovered by some eminent Scientists. However, there is no consensus of opinion among the scientists in this respect. This paper attempts to obtain some consensus of opinion among the Scientists in this respect by using some validated experimental data.
