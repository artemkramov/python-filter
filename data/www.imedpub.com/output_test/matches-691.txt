Prevalence and Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Bacteria Isolated From Bovine Mastitis
Mastitis is an inflammatory reaction of the udder tissue which is caused by the bacterial infection. Bovine mastitis is one of the devastating disease causing huge loss to the dairy industry worldwide. The present study investigated the current status of clinical and subclinical mastitis among dairy cattle in Dharwad district, Karnataka. The prevalence of mastitis was assessed by surf field mastitis test (SFMT), measure of pH and also based on the result of bacteriological evaluation of milk samples. A total of 185 isolates were recovered from 120 milk samples. The major pathogens isolated from the milk samples were S.aureus, E.coli, coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), Streptococcus species, Bacillus subtillis, Serratia marcesens and other Bacillus species. Antibiogram studies were also conducted for the isolates by using fourteen antibiotics like kanamycin, cloxacillin, rifampicin, ampicillin, penicillin-G, carbencillin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, polymyxin-B, streptomycin, gentamicin and amikacin which were used frequently in this area for the treatment of mastitis and tetracycline was found to be more effective antibiotic among all the tested antibiotics.
