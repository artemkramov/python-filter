Structure and Analysis of Compartmental Epidemiological Models
We study compartmental epidemiological models of the form x&amp; = A(x) x, xÎÃ¯ÂÂ¡ n , where A(x) is the so called Metzler matrix. We prove that for such systems there exist an energy function V (x) which can be used to establish the stability of the critical points of the system.
