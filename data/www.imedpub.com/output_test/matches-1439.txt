Physicochemical characteristics and triglyceride composition of Mimusops elengi seed oil
The lipid fraction of Mimusops elengi seeds was extracted and analyzed for their chemical and physical properties such as acid value, iodine value and density as well as refractive index, colour and moisture. The fatty acid composition of the extracted lipid was revealed using the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Palmitic acid (53.55%) and oleic acid (28.52%) were detected as the dominant fatty acids in the Mimusops elengi seed oil. The TAG profile of the lipid was detected using reverse phase HPLC. The major TAGs found are OLLn(29.23%), PLL (19.30%), OOL(17.24%) and OOO(13.93%)
