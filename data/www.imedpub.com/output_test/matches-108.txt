Electron tranfer reactions of L- aspartic acid andpermanganate ion in aqueous acidic medium
Kinetics and mechanistic studies ofelectron transfer reaction of L- aspartic acid () and permanganate ion in aqueous acidic media have been carried out at 29.0 ±1.00C, I = 1.0 mol dm-3 (Na2SO4), [] = 2.0 x10-1 mol dm-3. The reaction is first order with respect to permanganate ion and  concentrations and reaction rate showed dependence on acid concentration. The reaction conforms to the rate equation. -   [ 
 ][ ]. The rate of reaction increase with increase in ionic strength. Added cations and anions catalysed the reaction, spectroscopic investigations indicated that precursor complex formation did not precede the electron transfer step, but Michaelis Menten’s plot 0f /kobo1/kobs versus 1/[], showed a positive intercept by least square analysis. A plausible mechanism has been proposed for this reaction.
