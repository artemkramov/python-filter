Wind induced overtopping risk of a breakwater
When the waves break on the slope of break water in the breaking zone, some amount of wave energy by turbulence due to wave breaking the remaining energy induced the waves to over top the break water. The vertical distance between highest water level and water table levels is known as the foreshore level of wave in breakwater zone. This study follows the previous studies which are paid escalade waves on the impermeable beach smooth. Wind Induced overtopping risk of a breakwateris calculated during a service period using data from local wind and the average occurrence of strong winds and the performance function , z, for theovertopping event and apply the method AFOSM (Advanced First Order Second Moment)for the feature confidence and likelihood of occurrence overtopping for a strong wind. Firstly the results show that the risk for three different values ( ) are very variable. Secondly, If the water level is higher, considering the type of probability distribution for the wind will be more sensitive; As can be seen, in lesser ( ), more differences is obtained in the probabilities of each distribution.
