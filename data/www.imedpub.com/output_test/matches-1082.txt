Determination of Activity Concentration and Radiological Parameters of Natural Radionuclides for Soil Samples from Kogi State University Staff Nursery and Primary School, Kogi State
The activity concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides 226Ra, 232Th and 40K, in soil samples collected from the Kogi State University, Anyigba staff Nursery and Primary School were determined by Gamma spectroscopy method. The average activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K for SSN soil samples were found to be 78.67 ± 40.51, 11.50 ± 9.83, 4.15 ± 3.27 Bqkg-1, respectively; and SSP soil samples have average activity concentration values of 81.06 ± 53.28, 16.79 ± 18.00, 6.08 ± 2.73 Bqkg-1, respectively. The results obtained for the corresponding radionuclides are lower than the worldwide average values of 35, 30 and 400 Bqkg-1, respectively. The average absorbed dose rate in air (D) and the annual effective dose rates equivalent (AEDE) due to 226Ra, 232Th and 40K were observed to be 7.30 nGyh-1 and 8.95 μSvy-1, respectively for SSN, and 10.26 nGyh-1 and 12.58 μSvy-1, respectively for SSP. These values are all below the world average value of 60 nGyh-1 and 80 μSvy-1, respectively; the average radium equivalent (Raeq) activity, internal and external hazard indices estimated for SSN were 11.10 Bqkg-1, 0.04 and 0.03; and 15.29 Bqkg-1, 0.07 and 0.04, respectively for SSP. These values are also less than the world average values of 370 Bqkg-1 and unity, respectively. These results indicate that there are no associated radiological hazards.
