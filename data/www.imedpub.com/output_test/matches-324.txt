Hydromagnetic oscillatory flow through a porous medium bounded by two vertical porous plates with heat source and soret effect
An oscillatory hydromagnetic flow through a porous medium bounded by two vertical parallel porous plates is analyzed. One plate of the channel is kept stationary and the other is moving with uniform velocity. The plates of the channel are subjected to constant injection and suction velocities respectively. By considering the heat source and the Soret effects, closed form solutions of the governing equations are obtained for the velocity, the temperature and the concentration profiles. The effects of the various parameters entering into the problem on the velocity, the temperature, the skin friction and the rate of heat and the mass transfer coefficient are numerically evaluated and discussed with the help of graphs and tables
