Extraction and separation studies of Palladium(II) with 4-(4- methoxybenzylideneimino)-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol in hydrochloric acid medium
A novel method is proposed for the extraction of microgram level concentration of palladium(II) from hydrochloric acid medium with 4-(4-methoxybenzylideneimino)-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol(MBIMTT) dissolved in chloroform as an extractant. The palladium(II) from the organic phase is stripped with 50 % ammonia solution and determined spectrophotometrically with pyrimidine–2-thiol as a reagent. The method affords the binary separation and determination of palladium(II) from the alloys and synthetic mixture. The method is successfully applied for the separation and determination of palladium from the catalysts. The method is highly selective, simple and reproducible.
