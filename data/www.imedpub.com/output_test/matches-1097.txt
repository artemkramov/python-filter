Lossless medical image compression by IWT
Image compression has become an important process in today’s world of information exchange. Image compression helps in effective utilization of high speed network resources. Medical Image Compression is very important in the present world for efficient archiving and transmission of images. Integer wavelet Transform (IWT) show the effectiveness of the methodology used, different image quality parameters are measured and observed the increased higher PSNR values. Homogeneous data in radiological image databases consumes an extraordinary amount of storage space. Lossless compression algorithms are imperative for efficient storage and transmission of volumetric data sets. The proposed work is to compress the medical data without any loss (i.e. lossless). Medical information is either in multidimensional or multi-resolution form, this creates enormous amount of data. Retrieval, Efficient storage, management and transmission of this voluminous data are highly complex. This technique combines integer transforms and JPEGLS Prediction to enhance the performance of lossless compression
