Synthesis of cadmium-doped copper oxide nanoparticles: Optical and structural characterizations
Pure and cadmium-doped copper oxide nanoparticles have been successfully prepared by a microwave assisted solvothermal method using copper acetate as the starting material. The particle sizes have been obtained as, 10-14 nm for pure CuO and 42-87 nm for cadmium-doped CuO nanoparticles.The synthesized both pure and cadmiumdoped copper oxide nanoparticles have been characterized by using XRD, SEM–EDAX and UV–Visible analysis techniques. From the XRD study, it is found that the prepared samples are in the monoclinic system. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) pattern shows the spherical morphology of the prepared nanoparticles. The presence of dopant in the doped sample is found by using EDAX measurements. The optical property of cadmium-doped copper oxide nanoparticles are measured by UV-Visible spectroscopy
