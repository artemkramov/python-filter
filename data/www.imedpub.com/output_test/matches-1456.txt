Anxiolytic activity of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. leaves
The present study was designed to evaluate the anxiolytic effects of ethanolic extract of leaves of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam (ZME). It contains flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids and tannins as major chemical constituents. The experimental model used was elevated plus maze and light and dark box paradigm. The effect of extract on neurotoxicity was studied using rota-rod apparatus. The result of the study showed that treatment with diazepam and ZME significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the time spent and the number of entries in open arms and decreased the time spent in closed arms compare to normal control in elevated plus maze. On the light and dark box paradigm the treatments with diazepam and ZME significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the time spent in bright arena, number of entries in bright arena and decreased the time spent in the dark arena. The extract shows absence of neurotoxicity on rota-rod. It is concluded that the ethanolic extract of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. leaves possesses anxiolytic effects
