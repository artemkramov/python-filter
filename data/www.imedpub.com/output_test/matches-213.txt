The Development of Eco-friendly Photoelectrochemical solar cell Using Extract of Lonchocarpus cyanescens as a Natural Sensitizer
In this study, the crude ethyl acetate extract of Lonchocarpus cyanescens has been used in the fabrication of a photoelectrochemical cell which produced light conversion efficiency of 0.37%. The result demonstrates the potential of the cheap, eco-friendly natural product as a promising alternative sensitizer.
