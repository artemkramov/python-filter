Solution of optimization of a 3K experimental settings using the technique of Newton Raphson
xComputer spreadsheet is used in solving optimization problem of several variables involving four factors that are varied at three levels each. The fitted equation obtained from the regression analysis has an R-Sq =98.5 and R-Sq (adj) = 96.9.Multivariate optimization technique of Newton Raphson is used to locate the maximum of the function which contains several variables, starting at an initial points (0,0,0,0), the final optimal and physically realistic economically acceptable combinations are found at y = f(0.2,0.1, 0.1, 0.1) 0.9684. Which clearly demonstrated that the principle of normal curve is depicted. Recommendations are made which include the advantage of this method in determining or locating the optimum in case of minimum or saddle points in the response.
