N-{[2-Pyridine-2-azo)-5-Hydroxyl] Phenyl}-4-Methoxy benzilidenimine (LPYA) as a corrosion inhibitor of mild steel in 0.5M HCl
The weight loss technique has been used to study the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 0.5 HCl acidic medium by the Schiff base N – {[- 2 Pyridine – 2 – azo) – 5 – Hydroxyl] Phenyl} – 4 – Methoxybenzilidenimine ( LPYA) at 303K, 313K, 323K, 333K and 353K. Increase in temperature increased the inhibition efficiency at the temperatures studied. Thus, maximum inhibition efficiency of 99.30% was obtained at an optimum concentration of (1.0×10-2M) and at the highest temperature of 353K. The phenomenon of chemical adsorption has been proposed since an increase in temperature shows a corresponding increase in its inhibition efficiency.
