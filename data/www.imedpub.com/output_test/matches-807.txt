Pesticides are among most hazardous chemicals causing risks to environment, fisheries or people exposed to them. Due to the biodegradability and short residence time in the environment, organo-phosphate pesticides are increasingly used in recent years. The present study analysed the alterations in various behavioural patterns of the climbing perch in a novel environment like open field as a result of exposure to sublethal concentration of pesticide methyl parathion. We also tested whether there is any equivalent change in the total protein content of telencephalon. Our results suggest that the exposure to pesticides influences the behavioural activities of the organism and makes marked changes in normal functioning of brain centers involved in the control of the exploratory behaviour of the fish. The knowledge of sublethal effects of xenobiotic compounds is very important to delineate the fish health status and provide a future understanding of ecological impacts
