Performance analysis of ejector refrigeration system with environment friendly refrigerant driven by exhaust emission of automobile
Ejector refrigeration is a thermally driven technology which utilizes low grade thermal energy for its operation. This paper experimentally investigates the performance analysis of ejector refrigeration system with R404A as refrigerant. The ejector refrigeration system used exhaust emission of automobile as thermal energy for providing heat to refrigerant in the generator. Effect of different operating parameters on the performance of system has been investigated. The result shows that system using R404A as refrigerant can be used in the ejector refrigeration system for area ratio 7.84. Cooling capacity of the system increases with increase in evaporator temperature and generator temperature
