Production of fufu from yellow cassava roots using the odourless flour technique and the traditional method: Evaluation of carotenoids retention in the fufu
Yellow root cassava varieties are being propagated in Nigeria to aid in combating dietary vitamin A deficiency in the country due to their high content of β-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A). Three newly released yellow root cassava varieties: Umucass 36, Umucass 37 and Umucassa 38 (with Breeders’ names TMS/01/1368, TMS/01/1412 and TMS/01/1371, respectively) were assessed for their potential usage in processing into acceptable fufu using the odourless flour technique and by the traditional method. Carotenoid content in the intermediate and finished products of these varieties were evaluated. Results showed that while the fresh yellow roots had 6.26-7.76 μg/g and the fresh white root check variety (TMS 30572) had 0.35 μg/g total carotene (TC) contents, the intermediate products of the yellow root varieties namely grated cassava mash and fermented cassava mash respectively had TC content of 6.24-7.75 μg/g (TC retention of 97.68-98.48 %) and 5.97-7.48 μg/g (94.68-96.66% retention capacity). The final products of the three varieties had 5.41-7.03 μg/g (86.42-90.24% retention capacity). This implies negligible loss (&lt;2.3%) of TC incurred during grating, less than 6% loss incurred during fermentation of the grated mash and less than 14% loss incurred during the entire process of production of fufu from the yellow cassava roots by the traditional method. The intermediate products using the odourless flour technique had 5.93-7.53 μg/g (TC retention ranged from 94.68-94.73%) for grated cassava mash; 1.50-2.12 μg/g (21.55-33.87% retention) for fermented cassava flour; and the final product (cassava fufu) had 1.20-2.00 μg/g (17.24-31.94% retention). The losses were mainly incurred during the drying processes. Sensory evaluation results showed that, generally, fufu produced from the yellow cassava roots (fufu produced by the traditional method) was more acceptable by the Taste Panel than the fufu produced using the odourless flour technique. The use of traditional method for production of fufu when using yellow root cassava varieties is therefore recommended for maximum utilization of the nutrient in the newly released yellow cassava varieties.
