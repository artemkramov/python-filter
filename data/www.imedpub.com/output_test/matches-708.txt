The data base, land use and land cover and solid waste disposal site - using remote sensing and GIS: A case study of Sakkottai Ã¢ÂÂ block, Sivagangai District, Tamil Nadu, India
The problem associated with the solid waste disposal site in today’s society is complex because of the quantity and diverse nature of the wastes. Rapid urbanization, limitations of funding, emerging limitations of both energy and raw materials and also add to the complexity of any waste management system. The SWM system is one of the key components of the infrastructure for a sustainable community. Therefore, solid waste will have to be managed by technologies and methods that support sustainable communities and environments. In the present study it was tried to find out the potential waste disposal sites using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for Karaikudi Municipality. Selection of suitable sites for waste disposal is based on several factors. GIS technology using Weighted overlay analysis help to select the possible suitable solid waste disposal sites and are categorized in to three category. There are Good, Moderate and Poor. Among these categories, the sites which are in between the 4-5km buffer is selected for the disposal of solid wastes. Accordingly environmental, transportational and economic point of view suitable site is identified. On the basis of integration of various parameters IRS- P6 LISS III imagery and GIS as a tool have been found to be very useful for the interpretation and identification of solid waste disposal site. Thus with the use of these technologies management of municipal waste will no longer be a problem for city administrators.
