Soret and Dufour effects on MHD mixed convective heat and mass transfer flow with thermophoresis past a vertical flat plate embedded in a saturated porous medium in the presence of radiation and viscous dissipation
The effects of Soret and Dufour and MHD on Darcy-Forchheimer mixed convection flow with heat and mass transfer from a vertical flat plate embedded in a saturated porous medium taking into the influence thermophoresis, viscous dissipation and radiation. The fluid is considered in a grey medium and the Rosseland approximation is used to describe the radiative heat flux in the energy equation. A similarity solution for the transformed governing equations is obtained. The coupled non-linear ordinary equations are linearized by using Quasi-linearization technique. The governing coupled ordinary differential equations are being solved by employing an implicit finite difference scheme. Numerical computation are carried out for the non dimensional physical parameters. The results are analyzed for the effect of different physical parameters, such as radiation R, Soret number Sr, Dufour Df, Viscous dissipation Ec, mixed convection parameter Rax/Pex , buoyancy ratio N, inertia parameter Λ, magnetic field parameter Ha, Prandtl number Pr, Lewis number Le, Schmidt number Sc and thermophoretic parameter τ.
