Corrosion inhibition of low carbon steel in CO2 -saturated solution using Anionic surfactant
Corrosion inhibition of carbon steel alloy in 1.0 % NaCl saturated with CO2 by synthesized sulfated fatty acid sodium salt (SFASS) as an anionic surfactant inhibitor have been investigated using weight loss measurements, Extrapolation of cathodic and anodic Tafel plot and Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR bubble test). The data obtained from all the used methods are in good agreement with each other. These studies have shown that SFASS is a very good ’’green’’, mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibition process was attributed to the formation of an adsorbed film on the metal surface that protects the metal against corrosive agents. The inhibition efficiency increases with increasing both the concentration of the studied inhibitor and temperature. Maximum inhibition efficiency of the surfactant is observed at concentrations around its critical micellar concentration (CMC). The surface activity of the synthesized surfactant solutions was determined using surface and interfacial tension measurements at 25 °C. Thermodynamic adsorption parameters of studied inhibitor were calculated using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The protective film formation on metal surface is investigated by means of FTIR.
