Complexes of urea with Mn(II), Fe(III), Co(II), and Cu(II) metal ions
The complexation of urea (U) with manganese(II), cobalt(II), iron(III) and copper(II) ions at different temperatures has been studied by many methods namely elemnental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, conductivity measurements, infrared and thermal analysis (TG/DTG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The high values of molar conductivity of the resulting urea complexes show them to be electrolytes in nature. The physical and spectral data were well explained in terms of the formation of CuCl2.2U.4H2O (1), CuCl2.2U.2H2O (2) CO(NO3)2.6U (3), CO(NO3)2.2U.4H2O (4), FeCl2.6U.3H2O (5), FeCl2.3U.5H2O (6) MnCl2.3U.3H2O (7), MnCl2.6U. (8). Complexes of urea (1, 3, 5 and 7), and (2, 4, 6 and 8) were synthesized at room temperature and 60 oC , respectively. On the basis of the infrared spectral data and the values of stretching vibrational bands of both –C=O and –NH2 groups, the complexation of metal ions toward urea was distinguished. The enhancement of the microbial treatments against bacteria (Escherichia Coli, Staphylococcus Aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Aspergillus Flavus and Candida Albicans) was assessed and a remarkable efficiency was recorded.
