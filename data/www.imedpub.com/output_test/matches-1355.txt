Geochemistry and economic potential of marble from Obajana, north central, Nigeria
Nigeria is endowed with varieties of valuable solid minerals and rocks. These minerals/rocks are capable of boosting the economic potentials of the country if fully exploited. Marble is one of such rocks that occur prominently in Obajana area of Kogi State, North Central, Nigeria. Twenty five (25) marble samples were subjected to geochemical, petrographic and physical analyses. Geochemical data show that the marble has variable geochemical characteristics; low dolomite CaMg(C03) (1.1-3.01%) and high calcite CaCO3 (94-98%). Physical tests indicate high compressive strength (93.46-95.77MPa), shear strength (13.84-13.34MPa) and low water absorption (0.30- 0.69%) respectively. Petrographical studies reveal that the marble contains calcite, dolomite, quartz, actinolite, phlogopite and graphite. Based on these characteristics, the marble from Obajana is suitable as raw materials for manufacture of lime, steel flux, drugs, toothpaste, lubricant, pesticide production, paper and paint. It is also important in the production of livestock feed, electrical insulators, flooring tiles and terrazzo chips. The marble is very suitable for cement production
