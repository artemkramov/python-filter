Effect of total soluble solid during storage of litchi fruits under different temperatures
Litchi (Litchi chinenesis Sonn.) is the most important fascinating sub-tropical fruit which deteriorates rapidly within 24 hours after harvest, if stored at ambient temperature (140C and 320C). Shahi variety of litchi was taken as a sample for evaluation of total soluble solid (TSS). The graded litchi was treated with different chemicals i.e. Sulphites, Borex and Bavistin. The treated and untreated litchis were packed in in different packaging materials. It was observed that the TSS (0Brix) of litchi fruits increased the storage period increased. Total soluble solids reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar and total sugar increased up to 10 days of storage of there after declined
