Measurement and evaluation of the excitation function in (ÃÂ±,xn) reactions on Au up to energy range 60MeV
The excitation function for (α, xn) reaction up to energy range 60 MeV on Au has been calculated using stacked foil technique. Excitations have also been calculated theoretically using computer code – ACT with and without the inclusion of pre-equilibrium emission. As expected, inclusion of pre-equilibrium contribution based on the excitation model along with compound nucleus calculation using the Hauser- Feshbach formalism reproduce well the measured excitation function. Interesting trends in the pre-equilibrium fraction with projectile energy has been observed
