An optimized method of DNA isolation from highly mucilage-rich okra (Abelmoschus Esculentus L.) for PCR analysis
In this present study we have developed the protocol for highly purity DNA isolation from the fresh leaves of Abelmoschus esculentus and PCR analysis for resultant DNA. Okra is quite difficult to work because of highly acidic polysaccharides (mucilage) and polyphenols present in whole plant, mainly in leaves &amp; fruits. A standard protocol of Doyle &amp; Doyle (1987) was reviewed and modified for DNA extraction from Okra tissues. Modification involved increase the volume of DNA extracting buffer (1.5ml/sample), decrease sample volume (50-60mg), higher salt concentration (5M) and use of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone employed, yielded a high quality DNA and was found to suitable for PCR and RAPD analysis.
