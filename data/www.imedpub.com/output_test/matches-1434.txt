A study of radon concentration in water and radon exhalation rate in soil samples belonging to Kapurthala district, Punjab, India
Radon and its daughter products are the major sources of radiation exposure and recognized as one of the health hazards for mankind. In the Present work, an attempt has been made to assess the levels of radon concentration in some drinking water samples and radon exhalation rate in soil samples belonging to some locations of Kapurthala district, Punjab. Radon concentrations were measured using RAD 7 electronic detector and radon exhalation rate were measured using can technique. The alpha sensitive solid state nuclear track detectors (LR-115 Type II) were used in the can technique. The radon values vary from 0.0342 Bq / l of Kaul Talwandi village to 0.204 Bq / l of Kapurthala. The Radium concentration in soil samples were found to vary from 2.40 Bq / Kg to 4.65 Bq / Kg and the values of exhalation studies ranges from 2.96 mBqkg-1hr-1 to 5.74 mBqkg-1hr-1. The values are found to be within the safe limits as recommended by the International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) and World Health Organization (WHO). The results reveal that these areas are safe from the health hazard point of view as for as the radon is concerned. A good correlation has been observed between radon and exhalation rate
