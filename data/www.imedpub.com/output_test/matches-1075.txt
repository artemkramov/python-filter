Assessment of Neem oil effect on hematological profile and towards peripheral blood mononuclear cells of goat
Neem oil (NO) was evaluated in previous experiments as a natural ectoparasiticide for sheep and goats. In this work a methodology was assessed to evaluate the effect of NO on PBMC and the haematological profile of goats. Bloodcells from Siriana, Sanen, Cashemere and Maltese goat (Capra hircus L.) breeds were assayed-in in vivo and in vitro tests. Several haematological parameters of blood from goat untreated and treated with NO were compared. There was no significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between NO treated and untreated goat’ haematological parameters at each sampling time considered. In addition, the NO effect towards goat PBMC cultured in RPMI medium was evaluated at 1:2 x 102 to 1:20 x 106 dilutions at 14, 21 and 40 h of exposure. The PBMC viability was revealed using WST-1 dye. The in vitro test reveals that the response of goat PBMC viability is concentration, incubation time and NO dose dependent. The PBMC Maltese and Saneen breed resulted the most suitable for in vitro viability evaluation.
