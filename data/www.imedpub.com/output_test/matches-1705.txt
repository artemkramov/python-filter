Thermodynamic study of binary mixtures of methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate with octane-1-ol
Thermodynamic properties involving density and ultrasonic velocities of binary liquid mixtures of methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate with octane-1-ol measured at 298.15 and 308.15 K temperatures and at atmospheric pressure. These fundamental properties have been fitted to recently proposed Jouyban-Acree model. Excess molar volume and deviations in isentropic compressibility were calculated from density and ultrasonic velocity respectively, and have been fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. The experimental values of ultrasonic velocity were used to calculate different derived thermodynamic parameters like excess specific acoustic impendence, excess intermolecular free length, excess available volume and excess intrinsic pressure. Graphical representations of all excess thermodynamic parameters used to explain type and extent of intermolecular interactions. Graphical variation for all these parameters shows positive deviation for excess molar volume, deviation in isentropic compressibility, excess intermolecular free length, excess available volume and negative deviation for excess specific acoustic impendence, excess intrinsic pressure
