Isolation and FTIR spectroscopy characterization of chitin from local sources
Chitin the second most abundant after cellulose biopolymer found in nature after, is produced by many living organisms, and is present usually in a complex with other polysaccharides and proteins. Chitin was found as a major component in arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids and myriapods), nematodes, algae and fungi. In this study Chitin was isolated from various species (crab, squilla, and shrimp) from the local sources and the functional properties of chitin were studied by Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy (FTIR) and Peak Fit version was used for data acquisition and handling
