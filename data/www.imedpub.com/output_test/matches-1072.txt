Sizing a stand-alone solar photovoltaic system for remote homes at Bakassi Peninsula
This study analyzes solar photovoltaic (SPV) module performance for sizing a stand-alone photovoltaic(PV) system for remote homes in Bakassi Peninsula, a tropical evergreen rain forest region along the African Atlantic Gulf of Guinea. The cost of a stand-alone SPV system and installation is calculated to be about N404,800.00. The total average ampere hour per day required is 1386Ah/d, the number of batteries required is 2 batteries of 12V- 200Ah each and the number of solar modules required is 8modules of 80W each. A stand-alone solar PV power supply system is established as a reliable and economical source of electricity in rural remote areas; especially in developing countries where the population is dispersed, with low income and lack power supply. The photovoltaic system is environmentally friendly as opposed to conventional sources of energy that cause depletion of vegetation and emit pollutants into the environment impacting it negatively.
