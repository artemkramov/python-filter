Physiochemical properties of crystalline etch products for CR-39 track detector after ÃÂ±-particles irradiation
The effect of α- particles from radiation source Am-241 with activity 1μCi on the nuclear track detector - NTD type CR-39, dimensions (28x28x1.2) mm3 were measured. The measurements included the changes in physical and chemical properties for the solution of etch crystalline products for CR-39 after irradiation by α-particles irradiation at two periodic times 0.3 h and 23 h for low and high doses respectively . The changes in organic compounds for etch products were measured by using of FTIR - spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope – TEM . FTIR – spectroscopy shown there was decrease in the values of transmission percent ratios - Tr of wave numbers 1787 , 2800, 839 and 1650 Cm-1 relative to wave number 792 Cm-1 respectively with increase of irradiation time of α-particles . The etch products after α-particles irradiation of CR-39 detectors were change to low molecular weight organ compounds as a results of degradation bonds and may be formed compounds 2.2-oxy diethanol and 2-propen as the reaction products . Also , shown from transmission electron microscope –TEM there was increase in the degradation amount of etching organic compounds with increase of irradiation time of α-particles . While the change in inorganic compounds for etch crystalline products after α- particles irradiation of CR-39 detectors were describe by using of polarized optical microscope - POM , which shown from its images there was broken in crystalline layers to small crystal with increase of irradiation time . The physiochemical properties which measured by FTIR spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope– TEM for organic etching products were better than the analysis of inorganic crystalline etching products by Polarized microscope-PM
