Development of ice creams from Soybean milk &amp; Watermelon seeds milk and Evaluation of their acceptability and Nourishing potential
Soybean and watermelon seeds are rich source of protein as well as minerals mainly iron yet they are not consumed by a large number of populations instead of their nutritional qualities. Guava is a rich source of ascorbic acid. The objective of the present study was to prepare nutritionally enhanced ice-creams by the incorporation of soy milk, watermelon seeds milk and guava pulp and evaluation of their acceptability and nourishing potential. Total six different types of ice creams were prepared from soymilk, watermelon seed’s milk as whole and their blends with or without addition of guava pulp. At 9 point hedonic scale products were evaluated for their appearance, flavor, mouth feel and overall acceptability in which most of the ice creams were liked moderately to very much and one ice cream were most acceptable i.e. blended milk (50% soymilk and 50% watermelon seed milk) ice-cream with guava pulp. The nutritional analysis of most acceptable ice creams indicated that protein and fat value was found to be excellent and iron as well as vitamin C content were also found in good amount in comparison to standard cow’s milk ice-cream. Thus these ice creams would be highly nutritious and acceptable by the population.
