Geostatistical analysis of porosity distribution from well log data, in part of Bornu Basin, North-eastern part, Nigeria Using Kriging and Co-Kriging methods
The porosity distribution from well log data of five oil wells, in part of Bornu basin, using Kriging and Co-Kriging methods was analyzed. The results shows that the North- Eastern part of the study area depicts a well developed sand region for hydrocarbon accumulation with porosity distribution ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 with Kinasar-1, and Masu-1 wells showing an excellent distribution. The effect of intrusive bodies for which the basin is well noted for on the porosity distribution was clearly shown in Kinasar-1, Wadi-1 and Gaibu-1 oil well. The Southern regions of the study area have poor porosity distribution ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. The depositional current at the North was high and very low at the South suggesting that the sediments were deposited during the transgressive phase.
