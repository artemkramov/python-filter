Vertical electrical sounding (VES) for subsurface geophysical investigation in Kanigiri area, Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, India
Electrical resistivity investigation was carried out around, Kanigiri area, Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, India in order to study the subsurface geologic layer with a view of determining the depth to the bedrock and thickness of the geologic layers. Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) using Schlumberger array was carried out at fifteen (15) VES stations. The field data obtained have been analyzed using computer software (IPI2win) which gives an automatic interpretation of the apparent resistivity. The VES results revealed heterogeneous nature of the subsurface geological sequence
