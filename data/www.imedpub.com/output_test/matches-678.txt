Contaminant evaluation of major drinking water sources (boreholes water) in Lapai metropolis
Borehole water samples were collected from seven major locations covering an area of about 3,051km2 around Lapai metropolis in Niger State north-central Nigeria to evaluate its quality for household and human drinking purposes. The area covered falls within longitude 9°03’N and latitude 9°34’E. After each sample was collected, in-situ measurements were made for conductivity, pH, and temperature using Sension Platinum Series portable pH and Conductivity meter (HACH made). The results indicated that the values of pH in borehole BH1 and BH4 were found to be 4.6 and 4.4 against the value recommended by the FEPA, 1998 and WHO, 1992 of 6.5 to 9, thus were very acidic due to dissolved minerals as a result of leaching or corrosion of sink pipes. The pH values for BH2, BH3, BH5, and BH6 were 6.5 while BH7was 6.6 indicating that they were recommended for consuming. The conductivity values obtained were very low compared to the WHO 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1998 in the order of BH2&lt; BH1
