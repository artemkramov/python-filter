Investigation and inhibition of aluminium corrosion in hydrochloric acid solutions by organic compound
The corrosion inhibition of Aluminium by ATA in 1M HCl has been investigated by Weight Loss (WL), Temperature effect and electrochemical techniques such as Potentiodynamic polarization studies were used. Results showed that ATA has good inhibition efficiency on the corrosion of Aluminium in 1M HCl solution. Polarization measurement indicated that, the studied inhibitor act as a mixed type one. The inhibition efficiency depends on the concentration of inhibitor and reaches 93.4% at 30oc. The results obtained from the different methods are in good agreement. The adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the surface obeys adsorption isotherm. The adsorption free energy of inhibitor molecules on Aluminium reveals a physical adsorption of the inhibition on the metal surface. The SEM examination of the Aluminium surface revealed that the compound prevented from corrosion by adsorption on its surfaces.
