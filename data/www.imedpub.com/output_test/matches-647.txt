An investigation into the geomagnetic and ionospheric response during a magnetic activity at high and mid-latitute
In this work, we have presented a Geomagnetic and Ionospheric response to solar wind activity of the Geomagnetic storm of April 14, 2006. The indicators used in this work; foF2, Dst, Bz and flow speed implies an intense storm in the perturbation of both the Earth’s magnetic field and the peak electron density of the F2 layer, and these perturbation in turn could affect global communication given that intense storms could occur simultaneously across the globe. It was also noted that the time the enhancement was observed at the Ionospheric stations corresponds to the point when the Bz experiences a northward orientation. Also at this time, the Dst began to reduce to its peak minimum value as well as the intensification of the ring current, as indicated by the flow speed plot. All these points to the fact that the southward turning of Bz may have been accompanied by an increase in solar wind dynamic pressure which may have led to an enhanced coupling between the solar wind and the terrestrial magnetosphere that significantly increased the geoeffectiveness of the solar wind. Moreover, the average Ionospheric electron content enhancement observed at the high latitude stations of Petrropalvosk, Magadan and the mid-latitude stations of Khabarovsk and Tashkent between the hours of 0800UT and 1200UUT could be attributed to the response of the charged particles to the neutral atmosphere in the thermosphere, which automatically produces waves and changes in the thermospheric winds and composition. On the overall, the storm event could be regarded as a negative phase one.
