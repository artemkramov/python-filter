Screening of fungi isolated from poultry farm soil for keratinolytic activity
Poultry farm soil samples collected from different localities of Ernakulum and Thrissur districts of Kerala were screened for the keratinolytic fungi. During the course of study 8 different fungi were isolated and identified. Aspergillus, Chrysosporium, Microsporum, Trychophyton and Penicillium were the fungi isolated and were grown in wheat bran substrate. Feather keratin powder was added to the substrate to enhance the enzyme production. They were found utilizing keratin substrate releasing keratinase enzyme into the medium. These enzymes were assayed for their activity. Some cultural conditions were tested to attain maximum Keratinase production. Maximum enzyme production was reached on the 4th day of incubation of the culture at 37oC and pH 8.5
