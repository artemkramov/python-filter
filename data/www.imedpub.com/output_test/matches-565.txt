A fuzzy logic based Approach to Minimize the Rental Cost of Machines for Specially Structured Three Stages Flow Shop Scheduling
This paper is an attempt to introduce the concept of specially structured n-jobs, three machine flow shop scheduling in which the processing time of jobs are uncertain that is not known exactly and are in fuzzy environment. Fuzzy logic poses the ability to mimic the human mind to effectively employ modes of reasoning that are approximate rather than exact. The fuzzy processing times are described by triangular fuzzy membership function. Further the average high ranking (AHR) of fuzzy processing times are not random but bear a well defined relationship to one another. The objective of the present paper is to develop a heuristic algorithm to minimize the rental cost of machines under the specified rental policy. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the computational efficiency of proposed algorithm.
