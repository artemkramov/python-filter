Beekeeping Prospects: Palynology and the Environment
Pollen anatomical analysis was made of four pollen pellet samples from honeycombs obtained from four locations in Anyigba, Kogi State. The investigation sought to examine and ascertain the species of plants which were foraged by the honey bees. The pollen pellet samples were acetolysed and analyzed microscopically. A total of forty five pollen types belonging to twenty two families were identified. Identifications were carried to generic level and sometimes to species or only to family levels. Some predominant identified taxa include Elaeis guineensis, Poaceae, Nauclea latifolia an members of the Asteraceae/Tubiliflorae types (Aspilia-Tridax- Chromolaena complex). From this identification, the botanical and geographical origin of each sample were determined and also associated with definite vegetation type (the vegetation of lowland rainforest and Guinea savanna).
