In vitro propagation of an important medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. from axillary bud explants
An efficient in vitro micro propagation technique for multiple shoot induction has been developed for Artemisia annua L. using axillarybud explants in different concentrations and combination of plant growth regulators in order to produce multiple shoots. The results showed that the nodal segments with axillarybud cultured on MS basal medium fortified with 1.5mg/l BAP+0.5mg.l NAA facilitated favorable shoot induction. The well developed shoots were transferred on rooting medium (MS) supplemented with various concentration of IBA. The medium supplemented with 1.0mg/l of IBA, showed efficient root induction and further development of healthy roots. The well rooted plantlets were acclimatized and successfully established in field with 85% of survival
