Proteomics: A hallmark tool for identification of Biomarker (LIPASE) in type I &amp; II diabetes mellitus patients.
Proteomics is an indispensable tool in present day research. It has become important specifically in identification of various proteins and biomarkers for diagnosis of various diseases. In the present proteomic study, a similar approach has been applied for identification of proteomic biomarker by 2-D Gel electrophoresis in diabetic patients. 100 blood samples withdrawn from diabetic patients attending diabetic clinic were analyzed for concentration of lipase and glucose and the serum samples were run on SDS-PAGE gel .Result: Lipase, glucose levels of diabetic patients were above normal range in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients (NIDDM) and the results were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.0001). Band pattern of SDS-PAGE showed that the band of lipase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), M-isoformphosphofructokinase (M-PFK) of IDDM were intense (darker) than NIDDM and normal individuals. Conclusion: Lipase along with other metabolites i.e. SOD and M-PFK has been identified as biomarker in diabetes mellitus. Identified biomarkers can be of immense help for diagnosis of endocrinal dysfunction.
