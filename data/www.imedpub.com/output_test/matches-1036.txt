Effect of the annealing temperature on the current-voltage and Hall effect studies of Bi2S3 thin films grown on glass substrates by using chemical bath deposition
Bi2S3 thin films have been prepared and annealed at different temperatures (1500C, 2000C and 2500C) by chemical bath deposition method. The effect of annealing temperature of Bi2S3 films on I-V characteristics and Hall Effect studies were investigated. The current-voltage (I-V) studies show that current is directly proportional to the applied voltage. The increase in conductivity is due to the improvement in the crystallinity of films, which decreases the resistivity. Hall Effect results show that the Hall coefficient increases with hall mobility and annealed temperature. Bi2S3 films are found to be n-type semiconductor
