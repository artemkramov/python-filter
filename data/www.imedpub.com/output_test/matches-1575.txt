Resource-use efficiency of small holders root and tuber expansion programme(RTEP) In Plateau state, Nigeria: An application of stochastic frontier production function
Using a cross sectional data obtained through a multistage sampling technique, this study estimated the technical efficiency of small holders RTEP participants and non-participants in Plateau State, Nigeria and further examined the factors that determined the differential in efficiency index. A total of 160 RTEP participants and nonparticipants in the study area were randomly selected for the study. The stochastic frontier production model was used in the analysis to determine the relationship between output and the level of input used in the study area. The empirical results revealed that farm size was significant at 5% for RTEP participants only. Planting materials, fertilizers and hired labour were statistically significant at 5% level. The estimated gamma parameters (γ) of 0.89 for RTEP participants and 0.94 for non-participants indicated that 89% and 94% of the total variation in total output was due to technical inefficiencies of the respondents. The mean technical efficiencies (χ) level was 0.91 for RTEP participants and 0.56 for non-participants. It was therefore concluded that there was scope for increasing root and tuber crops production by 0.91% for RTEP participants and 54% for non-participants with the present technology. Therefore the study confirmed that increased land, planting material, fertilizer and hired labour can be used in the area for both RTEP participants and non participants.
