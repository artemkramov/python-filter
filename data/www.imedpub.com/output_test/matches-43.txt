Synthesis, characterisation and antimicrobial studies on La(III), Ce(III) and Pr(III) complexes with a tetraaza macrocyclic Ligand
The Lanthanide(III) complexes of the chloro , hydroxo substituted 14-membered tetraaza macrocyclic solid complexes of La(III), Ce(III) and Pr(III) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, conductometry, magnetic susceptibility, UV–visible, FTIR, 1H NMR spectra, X-ray diffraction, and thermal analysis and screened for antimicrobial activity. From the microanalytical data, the stoichiometry of the complexes has been found to be 1:1 (metal:ligand). The TGA-DSC data suggest all Lanthanide (III) complexes having one ionic nitrate, two coordinated nitrate ions, two water molecules for Ce(III) and four water molecules for La(III) and Pr(III). The X-ray diffraction data suggest orthorombic crystal system for La(III) and monoclinic crystal system for Ce(III) and Pr(III) complexes. The ligand and their metal complexes were screened for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Fungicidal activity against Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma viride.
