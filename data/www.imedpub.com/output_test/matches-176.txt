The inhibitive effect of Irvingia gabonensis extract on the corrosion of aluminium in 1M HCl solution
The inhibitive effect of leaf extract of Irvingia gabonensis on the corrosion of aluminum in 1M HCl solution was investigated using chemical method at 30, 35 and 40 oC respectively. The inhibition efficiency for the extract increased with increasing concentration of the extract and decreased with increase in temperature. The adsorption of the inhibitor molecules on aluminium surface was found to obey Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The phenomenon of physical adsorption is proposed based on the thermodynamic parameters that govern the inhibition process.
