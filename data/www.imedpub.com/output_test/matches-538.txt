Photo catalytic degradation of two commercial dyes in aqueous phase using photo catalyst TiO2
The present study involves the photo catalytic degradation of methyl orange and methylene blue by heterogeneous photo catalytic process using TiO2 as semi conductor. An attempt has been made to study the effect of process parameters viz. → concentration of dye and pH on photo catalytic degradation of methyl orange and methylene blue. The experiments were carried out by the irradiating the aqueous solution of dyes containing photo catalyst with UV and solar light. The rate of decolorization was estimated from residual concentration spectro- photometrically. The % reduction of methyl orange and methylene blue was estimated under UV / solar system.
