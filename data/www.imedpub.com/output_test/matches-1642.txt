Destructive testing and production system integrity
Destructive testing of automobiles is performed to determine the tensile strength for static and dynamic stability of the welded vehicle body or part. The specific objectives of destructive testing are to detect and correct inactive welds and other production system weaknesses that may not show up under normal production conditions. This will ensure high system integrity and to determine service life of the products, processes and the production system. The testing was conducted using the Descriptive design. The sixteen (16) number destructive testing was evaluation using percentile and comparative method. The data collated were tabulated, analyzed and graphically presented using Micro-Soft Excel software. The major tools for the test include the Destructive Work Table, Hydraulic Spreader, Torque Wrench, Pneumatic Chisel and Personnel Protective Equipment. Hydraulic powered Spreader with the capacity of up to 700 Bars was used to split the welded metal sheets, while Chisel and Hammer are used to create maximum access for Spreader to enable good application. The tensile strength global targets are that failure should not exceed 0.5% and 1.0% for safety and non-safety welds respectively. The test frequency was one car for every 3months. The destructive tests result shows downward trends defined by Y = 0.642 – 0.020X for safety spots and Y = 0.986 – 0.013X for non-safety spots. The overall results show continuous improvement despite the incapability of some production means that questions the production system integrity.
