Analysis of electrical conductivity of ground water at different locations of Dildar Nagar of U.P, India
In this paper, we discuss about the recently collected sample of ground water at surrounding locations of Dildar Nagar village and its experimental analysis in laboratory for Electrical conductivity. Also, we represents the data graphically and interpreted the data using the method called analysis of variance. Further, we analyze our findings with the established results and concluded that electric conductivity depends on areas as well as months also
