Ex situ conservation of endemic orchids of Western Ghats, Tamilnadu, India via asymbiotic seed germination
The loss of plant genetic resources has necessitated the development of many ex situ conservation techniques. Micropropagation is one of the ex situ techniques that has been used increasingly for the conservation of endangered plants. This in vitro technique aids in mass propagation of the plant species facing risk of extinction. The application of plant tissue culture techniques in orchid conservation and propagation requires an efficient in vitro regeneration protocol. This study reports the development of such highly efficient protocols for the in vitro asymbiotic seed germination of three threatened orchids namely Coelogyne nervosa A.Rich., Eria pseudoclavicaulis Blatt. and Porpax reticulata Lindl. The application of in vitro seed propagation technique for orchid conservation is a powerful tool for ex situ conservation of biodiversity. With asymbiotic seed germination technology, thousands of seedlings could be raised to maturity from a single seed capsule.
