First order kinetics in thin films of KCl using thermo luminescence technique
The thermo luminescence of several thin films of KCl has been studied. The thermo luminescence of thin films KCl shows a prominent glow pick at 462 K. Chen’s Formulae were used extensively to calculate the trapping parameters for observed glow peaks. It has been concluded that the thermo luminescence of thin films of KCl is monomolecular processes and it obeys the first order kinetics. PACS: 78.60.Kn, Thermo luminescence; 61.72.J- Point defects and defect clusters.
