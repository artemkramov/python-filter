Studies on heavy metal pollution of ground water sources between Tamilnadu and Pondicherry, India
Eight ground water samples were collected in and around Karaikal areas during monsoon, winter and summer seasons and analyzed in order to find out pollution impact. The heavy metal analyses of Cu, Fe, Mn, Cr and Pb were performed for the water samples. This study aims at detecting the possibilities of ground water quality deteriorations due to the improper solid waste dumping with special reference to heavy metal pollution. From the data, it is shown that except Pb, the other heavy metals are present within the permissible limit. It is a well known fact that the heavy metal ions are potentially toxic to human health and could be quite detrimental for human life. Our study suggests the preventive measures which are to be adopted to control the contamination of excess Pb present in the ground water around this region.
