Design and Implementation of a High-Gain Compound Yagi Antenna
This paper presents the design and implementation of a high-gain compound Yagi antenna using aluminium rail of thickness, 2mm with high electrical conductivity and reflecting ability. The antenna operates in very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) bands covering a frequency range of 174 to 790MHz. It has a gain of 16.7dB and a radius of coverage of about 290km. It was constructed as a prototype antenna and tested at Hanala Motel and Kogi State University (KSU) staff quarters where signals from NTA 12 (Lokoja), NTA 8(Enugu), NTA 23 (Anpka), NTA 10 (Makurdi), OSRC 27 (Akure), CTV 55, (Lokoja), and NTA 6 (Anyigba) were received with sharp picture and audible sound. Better receptions were recorded for NTA 10, CTV55 and OSRC27 on extremely clear, calm and cool days.
