Unsteady slip flow of blood through constricted artery
Considering the Casson fluid as blood; the unsteady flow through a constricted artery has been studied. The governing equations have been solved by using the perturbation technique. Expressions for axial velocity, shear Stress, volumetric flow rate and plug flow velocity are obtained. The results are shown and discussed through graphs; choosing suitable parameters. The study shows that the axial velocity, wall shear stress and the volumetric flow rate decrease when the time increases along the axial distance. The axial velocity and the volumetric flow rate rise with an increase in slip velocity. The non – plug flow velocity, volumetric flow rate and wall shear stress decrease but the plug flow velocity increases with increase in stenosis height along axial distance.
