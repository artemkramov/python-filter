Radiation effect on an unsteady MHD free convective flow past a vertical porous plate in the presence of soret
Aim of the paper is to investigate the radiation effect on an unsteady megnetohydrodynamic free convective flow past a vertical porous plate in the presence of soret is analyzed. The problem is governed by the system of coupled non-linear partial differential equations whose exact solutions are difficult to obtain, if possible. So, Galerkin finite element method has been adopted for its solution . The flow phenomenon has been characterized with the help of flow parameters such as velocity, temperature and concentration profiles for different parameters such as Grashof number, modified Grashof number, Schmidt number, Prandtl number, Soret number, Magnetic field, Heat source and Radiation parameter. The velocity, temperature and concentration are shown graphically. The coefficient of skin-friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are shown in tables
