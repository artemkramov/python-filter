Studies of thermodynamic properties of methyl methacrylate with alkane-1-ols and alkane-2-ols
Densities and viscosities binary liquid mixtures of methyl methacrylate with octane-1-ol, decane-1-ol, octane-2-ol and decane-2-ol at 298.15 and 308.15 K and at atmospheric pressure were measured. Excess molar volumes and viscosity deviation were calculated and have been fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. The mixture viscosities were correlated using Hind, Choudhary-Katti, Grunberg-Nissan, Tamura-Kurata, Heric–Brewer, McAllister three and four body model equations. Recently proposed Jouyban Acree model was also used to correlate density and viscosity. Intermolecular interactions explained in terms of structure breaking dispersion forces. A graphical representation of excess molar volumes shows positive nature whereas deviation in viscosity shows negative nature. Positive values of excess molar volumes show that volume expansion is taking place causing rupture of H-bonds in self associated alcohols. Results are discussed in terms of molecular interactions prevailing in mixture.
