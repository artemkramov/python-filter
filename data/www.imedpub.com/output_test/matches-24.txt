Determination of refractive index, density, molar refraction and polarizability constant of substituted N,NÃ¢ÂÂ-bis(salicyliden)-rylmethanediamines in different binary mixture refractometrically
The molecular interactions in the solution are studied with the help of refractometric measurements. The densities and refractive index measurement of substituted N,N’-bis(salicyliden)-arylmethanediamines in two different solvents were performed. The experimental data so obtained used in the determination of molar refraction (Rm) and polarizability constant (α) of substituted-N,N’-bis(salicyliden)-arylmethanediamines drug.
