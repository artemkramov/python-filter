The properties of chemical bath deposited cadmium sulfide thin films with the effect of ammonia salt concentration
Cadmium sulfide thin film was prepared on glass substrate by a chemical bath deposition technique using aqueous cadmium chloride and thiourea solutions in a basic medium a (pH ~ 11.8) at 90oC for 4 hours. The structural and morphological properties of films obtained by CBD were investigated using X-ray diffraction, Scanning and Electron Microscope, Energy Dispersive X- ray Spectrometer, FT-IR Spectroscopy and photoluminescence. X-ray pattern showed that the CdS thin film deposited without any complexing agent was grown on an amorphous phase. SEM image showed that the CdS thin film deposited homogeneous, uniform grain size and good adhesion to the substrate. The band energy gap value was found as 2.61 eV.
