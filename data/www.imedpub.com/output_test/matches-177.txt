Isolation, characterization &amp; biomass production of Trichoderma viride using various agro products- A biocontrol agent
In the recent years, the environmental contamination caused by excessive use of chemical pesticides increased the interest in integrated pest management, where chemical pesticides are substituted by bio-pesticides to control plant pests and plant diseases. Trichoderma spp, is a potential fungal biocontrol agent against a range of plant pathogens. Present study deals with use of household waste, vegetable waste and other wastes and assessment for their suitability as substrates for mass multiplication of Trichoderma viride and develops effective production methodology which can be easily adopted. For the production of biomass of fungal grain media, organic media and non-synthetic media have been used. The maximum biomass production of Trichoderma spp. was observed in pulses (19.98 gm in 250 ml).
