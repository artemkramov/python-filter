Energy integration of vacuum distillation plant using pinch technology (A case study of KRPC VDU Unit)
Process integration is refer to as Energy integration if the aim is to optimized the use of energy in a process plant. Energy integration of Vacuum Distillation unit of Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company was carried out, using the principle of Pinch Technology. Optimum Temperature approach of 100C was obtained, the pinch point was found to be 3700C. The cold utility requirement for the traditional approach and pinch analysis were found to be 0.31 and 0.19MW respectively, while the hot utility requirement were found to be 0.32 and 0.24MW respectively. Hence pinch analysis as an energy integration technique saves more energy and therefore save more cost than the traditional approach
