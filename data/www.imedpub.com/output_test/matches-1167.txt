Determination of optimum maturity of north Sri Lankan KilichondanMango fruits (Mangifera indica L.) based on their biochemical properties
Mangoes (Mangifera indica, L.) produced in Northern Sri Lanka, are lost due to poor transportation and storage facilities. Optimum date for harvesting was determined to extend the postharvest life. Harvest maturity of Kilichondan mango cultivars grown in Northern Sri Lanka between April and January, were studied to reduce such losses. Though Kilichondan mangoes are delicious and economically positive for the poor, the maturity index of this variety has not been determined yet. Therefore this study was aimed at recommending proper maturity indices for Kilichondan mango and to analyze the physical and chemical properties of this fruit during ripening. Time after the full bloom stage, the colour of the skin, floating / sinking ability, total soluble solids (TTS), titratable acidity (TTA), moisture content, dry matter, TTS/TTA ratio were measured. Most fruits sank in water. TSS, pH, dry matter content increased rapidly, whereas TTA and moisture content percentage decreased rapidly towards maturity. Fruits harvested up to 93 days from full bloom stage, showed significant differences in the above mentioned values than the fruits harvested after 93 days from full bloom stage. 90 percent of fruits ripened on the tree after 97 and 98 days from full bloom stage where as fruits harvested after 98 days from full bloom stage were over-ripened and of poor quality. Since a non-destructive method reduces loss of yield, the study recommends the slightly yellow colour patchon the green shoulder, is an acceptable maturity index that appears on the 93rd day from full bloom stage for Kilichondan mango variety. Testing panel results confirmed the acceptable eating quality of these fruits after being ripened
