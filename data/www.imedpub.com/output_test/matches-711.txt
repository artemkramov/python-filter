A study of craniofacial parameters and total body height
Craniofacial anthropometry is used for studies of human growth population variation, forensic research, as a guide for clinical treatment and surgical repairs of any anomaly associated with the head region. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between craniofacial parameters and body height. 200 subjects (100 males and 100 females) were selected at random. Nine facial parameters as well as body height were measured. The data were analyzed using regression analysis. The results showed that the mouth width increases with height. Some parameters such as: total head circumference (Tc), cranial base width (t-t) and binocular width (ex-ex) decrease with increase in height. The total cranial length (g-op), total cranial height (v-gn), maximum cranial breadth (eu-eu), minimum frontal breadth (ft-ft) and supraorbital breadth (fz-fz) showed constancy with increase in height. It was observed that males have higher craniofacial parameters such as: mouth width, head circumference, and minimum frontal breadth than the females (p&lt;0.05). The females have higher cranial base width than the males. There is a relationship between craniofacial parameters and height. Craniofacial parameters may be useful in determining stature. Craniofacial parameters are sexually dimorphic. Thus craniofacial parameters may be used in identifying an individual’s gender.
