Anti-infective and anti-biofilm activity of Geodorum densiflorum (Lam.) Schltr. against Methicillin resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the common pathogens in clinical which cause hospital acquired infections in surgical wounds and delayed the healing mechanism of our immune system. Thus MRSA infections became a worldwide serious health problem. The study was to comparatively evaluate the antiinfective and anti-biofilm activity of Geodorum densiflorum (Lam.) Schltr. ethanol extract against MRSA and MSSA. The disc diffusion method, MIC and Biofilm inhibition assay were performed with clinical isolates of MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 3160) an MSSA organism. MSRA clinical isolates shows sensitivity to G. densiflorum extract at 75mg/ml (7.5 mg/disc) concentration while MIC range 2mg/ml and anti-biofilm activity of plant extract shows sensitivity at the concentration of 100mg/ml and 25mg/ml for MRSA and MSSA respectively. The study clearly revealed that ethanolic extract of G. densiflorum having effective inhibitory activity on both MRSA and MSSA strains
