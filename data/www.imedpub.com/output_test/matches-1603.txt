Apportionment of pollution loads arising from catchments in pond water bodies
The paper reports the sources of pollution in urban lentic water bodies (ponds) of Lucknow city. Owing to the unplanned development and urbanization, the ponds of this city are struggling for their existence. In spite of the global alarm for restoration of the water bodies, the ponds in the city are facing neglectance. The city sewage discharge, agriculture and urban runoff and continuous dumping of waste materials especially sanitary waste are affecting the water quality of these urban water bodies. There is considerable need for better understanding of these small impoundments so that they can be managed effectively.
