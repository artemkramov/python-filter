Detection of seepage around the embankments of freshwater storage reservoir in industrial complex, Thoothukudi, Tamilnadu, India
The aim of the study is to identify the seepage of freshwater around the embankment of reservoir through 2D electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) technique. Two freshwater reservoirs were built in the industrial complex, Thoothukudi with dimensions of 500m length and 300m width each and paved with insulating material at the bottom to arrest the seepage. The 2D ERI technique was conducted with the help of resistivity meter, Multicore cable, wire spool and rods in three profiles with Wenner Configuration. The collected resistivity data was converted in to the apparent resistivity data converted in to 2D pseudosection with the use of Res2DINV software. The freshwater zone(120 Ohm.m), Saltwater (1-5 Ohm-m), Clay (5-10 Ohm.m) and Sandstone (above 200 Ohm.m) in the obtained observation using 2D ERI technique. The pseudosection pictures were used for the quality and quantity of the seepage zone in the clay formation.
