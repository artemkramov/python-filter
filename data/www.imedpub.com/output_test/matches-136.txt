Physico-chemical, phyto-chemical and elemental analysis of stem bark and roots of Berberis asiatica
Berberis asiatica commonly known as Daruhaldi / Kilmora belongs to family Berberidaceae. It has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, diuretic, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, antioxidant, strong wound healer, anti-rheumatic and immunogogue properties. In the present investigation physicochemical parameters viz. ash values (total ash and acid insoluble ash), extractives values (ethanol soluble and water soluble), elements viz. Na, Ca ,Zn, K, Cu, Mg, Co, Fe and Li along with biochemical parameters viz. moisture content, total carbohydrate and crude fibre and phytochemical constituents were determined. Results of physicochemical analyses revealed from the present study can be used as a diagnostic tool for the standardization and identification of plant. Phytochemical screening suggests that there is similarity in phytochemical profile of root and stem bark. Elemental analysis would be beneficial for determining effectiveness of Berberis asiatica stem bark and root in treating various diseases which occur due to mineral deficiency.
