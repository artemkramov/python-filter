Synthesis of Schiff base and 4-oxo-thiazolidines of 5-bromo furan-2- carbohydrzide and their derivatives as an antimicrobial agent
A series of Schiff bases (2a-f) have been prepared by the condensation of 5-bromofuran-2-carboxyhydrazide (1) with different aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes. The synthesis of various 2-(substituted phenyl/quinolin 2-yl/6- methoxy naphthalen 2-yl)-3-(5'-bromofuran-2'-carboxamido) – thiazolidine-4-ones (3a-f) by cyclocondensation reaction between schiff bases (2a-f) and thioglycolic acid. Cyclocondensation of Schiff bases (2a-f) with thiolactic acid resulted 2-(susbstituted phenyl)-3-(5’-bromofuran-2'-carboxamido)–5-methyl thiazolidine - 4 - ones (4a-f). The structures of all the synthesised compounds were confirmed by their elemental analysis and IR, 1H NMR spectral data. All the synthesised compounds have been screened for their antimicrobial activity.
