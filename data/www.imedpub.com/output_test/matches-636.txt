Thermophoresis and viscous dissipation effects on DarcyÃ¢ÂÂForchheimer MHD mixed convection in a fluid saturated porous media
An analysis is presented to investigate the effects of thermophoresis on MHD Mixed convection, heat, and mass transfer about an isothermal vertical flat plate embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium in the presence of viscous dissipation . The similarity solution is used to transform the problem under consideration into a boundary value problem of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are solved numerically by using the finite difference method. Numerical computations are carried out for the non-dimensional physical parameter. The results are analyzed for the effect of different physical parameters such as thermophoretic , MHD, mixed convection, Eckert number, inertia parameter, buoyancy ratio, and Schmid number on the flow, heat, and mass transfer characteristics.
