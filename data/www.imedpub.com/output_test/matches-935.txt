Studies on Bon-acid based azo dyes and its metal chelates
New ligand i.e. 3-hydroxy-4--((5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)diazenyl)-2-naphthoic acid (DAPOBA) was synthesized by diazotization reaction of diazonium salt of 2-Amino-5-phenyl-[1,3,4]-Oxadiazole (APO) and Bon acid (BA). The synthesized novel ligand was further investigated by means of their physical properties, elemental analysis and spectral studies. The transition metal chelates of DAPOBA were prepared and characterized by metalligand (M:L) ratio and IR spectral studies. Furthermore, geometry of metal chelates confirmed through the reflectance spectral study and magnetic values. The antifungal activity of DAPOBA and its metal chelates was examined against various fungi shows clear enhancement in the activity of metal chelates upon coordination
