Effect of Erbium Doping on Structural and Photoluminescence Properties of LaPO4: Eu Phosphor.
The present paper reports the Photoluminescence (PL) of the LaPO4 phosphor doped with Er and Er:Eu rare-earth ions. The phosphors were synthesized using the standard solid state reaction technique and ground using mortar and pestle, fired at 1200oC for 4 hour in a muffle furnace.The X-Ray diffraction pattern reveals the grain size of the particle. The Infrared spectra for the prepared solid nanopowders were recorded in the range between 400 and 4000 cm_1 on a Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker Make,Vector-22 Model,OPUS_NT FT-IR). The PL emission of pure LaPO4 phosphor was observed at 470 nm and effect of Er and ,Er:Eu doped with LaPO4 also has been discussed.
