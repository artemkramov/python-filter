Hydromagnetic natural convection flow of an incompressible viscoelastic fluid between two infinite vertical moving and oscillating parallel plates.
In this paper, we study the thermal and mass diffusion on incompressible viscoelastic fluid flow (Rivlin-Ericksen) between two infinite vertical parallel plates moving in opposite direction, while one plate is oscillating in time and magnitude about a constant non-zero mean under the influence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. The suction velocity at the plate fluctuates with the time harmonically from a constant mean velocity. We have evaluated velocity distribution, temperature distribution, concentration distribution, phase and amplitude of the skin friction. The effects of magnetic parameter M, visco-elastic parameter S, Schmidt number Sc, Grashof number Gr, modified Grashof number Gc, and Prandtl number Pr on the above said physical quantities are discussed.
