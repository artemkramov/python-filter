Statistical evaluation of groundwater quality in and around Dindigul region, Tamilnadu, India
The study was carried out to assess the quality of ground water in and around Dindigul region, Tamilnadu, India. Twenty three groundwater samples were taken from the bore wells with necessary precautions. All the groundwater samples were subjected to analysis of physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals. Each parameter was compared with the standard limit prescribed by the WHO. The analyses show that Cl and Ca are the dominant anion and cation, respectively. The average abundance order of heavy metal contents in groundwater samples are Fe&gt; Pb&gt; Cd&gt; Cr&gt;Mn&gt;Zn&gt;Cu. The value of zinc, iron and manganese are below the permissible limit in all groundwater samples. But the value of chromium, lead and cadmium are exceeded the permissible limit in few groundwater samples. The statistical parameters such as mean, variance, standard deviation and co-efficient of variation are calculated. Pearson’s correlation co-efficient for physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were worked out. EC, TDS, Cl, Na, Ca and F are significantly correlated (0.61
