Study of an electrocoagulation (EC) unit for the treatment of industrial effluent of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
The assessment of industrial liquid waste of Ouagadougou shows 91262 m3 yr-1 total quantity of effluent composed mainly of tannery effluent. Treatment experiment by EC of these effluents allowed to eliminate chromium and to lower COD up to 86% abatement. The process designed for the treatment of liquid waste from tannery works at 10.5 m3 hr-1 for current density of 67.5 A.m-2, 62.5 V, 1.2 kWh m-3 energy consumption, and produces 86,000 m3 of clear water with 200 mg L-1 COD, 0 turbidity, 91% color abatement, 0 ppm chromium. The treatment produces nearly 480 m3 yr-1 of sludge after compression using filter-press and 216 T of dry matter containing chromium and iron hydroxides, organic and inorganic pollutants.
