Unsteady Convective Heat and Mass Transfer Flow of a Viscous Fluid in a Vertical Wavy Channel with Variable Wall Temperature and Concentration
We analyse the effect of chemical reaction on unsteady convective heat and mass transfer flow of a viscous fluid in a vertical channel bounded by wavy walls. The walls are maintained at oscillatory temperature and concentration. The flow takes place in the presence of temperature dependent heat sources. The non-linear equations governing the flow, heat and mass transfer are solved by employing a regular perturbation technique. The velocity, temperature and concentration are discussed graphically for different variations of G,M,a,b,g, k,N and x. The rate of heat and mass transfer on the boundary walls are evaluated numerically for different variations of the governing parameters.
