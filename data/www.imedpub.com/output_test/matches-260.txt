Nutritional Quality and Preference of Fufu processed from selected Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) Resistant Cultivars
Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) resistant cultivars were harvested fresh at 10-12 months old. Fufu flours were obtained from the cassava roots using advanced processing method. Proximate composition of fufu flours and sensory evaluation of their dough prepared from the Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) resistant cultivars were studied. Moisture content ranged from 7.31-8.40%, which were within the recommended standard for edible cassava flour (13% m/m Max.). Protein ranged from 0.35-2.45%, ash (0.15-1.50%), fat (0.12-0.61%), fiber (0.01- 0.20%), carbohydrate (81.81-90.37%) and dry matter (81.792.69%). Low protein, ash, fiber, fat and high carbohydrate and dry matter confer with the nutritional composition of cassava root. Sensory evaluation of dough prepared from the cassava fufu flours obtained showed that colour, odour, elastic quality, hand feel/texture and over all acceptability were all acceptable to the panelists. However, fufu prepared from TMS 97/3200 and 99/3037 were most acceptable for over-all acceptability. Therefore, this work recommends the promotion and utilization of these newly improved cassava cultivars for fufu production
