Dissipation and variable viscosity on steady MHD free convective flow over a stretching sheet in presence of thermal radiation and chemical reaction
A numerical analysis has been carried out on the effects of thermal radiation and viscous dissipation on steady magneto hydrodynamic free convective flow over a stretching sheet with variable viscosity in presence of chemical reaction. The governing partial differential equations are transformed to the ordinary differential equations using similarity variables, and then solved numerically by means of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with shooting technique. A comparison with exact solution is performed and the results are found to be in excellent. Numerical results for the velocity, temperature and concentration as well as for the skin-friction, Nusselt number, and the Sherwood number are obtained and reported graphically for various parametric conditions to show interesting aspects of the solution.
