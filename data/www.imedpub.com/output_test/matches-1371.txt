Production of biogas and greenhouse implication of its combustion device
Biogas was produced using cow dung and poultry droppings as substrates and its green house effect during combustion was examined. The biogas plant was operated using these substrates (cattle dung and poultry droppings) as feedstock in the ratio of 1 part of dung and dropping to 2 parts of water at a retention time of 30 days. A total of 1.197m3 of biogas was produced from cow dung biomass within a period of 30 days. Average daily production was 0.04m3/day from an average of 1.167Kg of dung. Peak gas production was observed at day 17 with production of 0.075m3 of biogas. Total gas produced using poultry droppings as substrate was 1.659m3 equivalent to 0.06m3/day from an average of 1.167Kg of Poultry droppings. Peak gas volume of 0.092m3 was observed at day 20. The results show that Poultry droppings has higher gas yield than cow dung. Furthermore, flue gas analysis was carried out to establish the emissions of the burners. The results show that solid biomass fuels are typically burned with substantial production of PIC (products of incomplete combustion). As a result, the emissions of CO2 and PIC per unit delivered energy are considerably greater in the biomass burners
