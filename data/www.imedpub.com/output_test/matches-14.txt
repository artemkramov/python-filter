Protective role of ascorbic acid on the cadmium induced changes in hematology of the freshwater fish, Channa orientalis (Schneider)
The study on fishes and their diseases has importance in life of human being because it has nutritive value. Fresh water fishes, Channa orientalis were exposed to chronic dose of CdCl2 without and with ascorbic acid. Total leukocytes count and hemoglobin content were recorded. Remarkable increase in TLC and decrease in Hb content were observed in cadmium exposed fishes. Fishes were exposed to heavy metals with L-ascorbic acid(50mg/l.) showed less present variation on the TLC and Hb content. Pre-exposed fishes to heavy metal showed fast recovery with ascorbic acid as compared to these cured naturally. The role of ascorbic acid on exposure to cadmium of an experimental fish, Channa orientalis is discussed in the paper
