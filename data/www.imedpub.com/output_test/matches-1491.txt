Suitability and assessment of groundwater for irrigation purpose: A case study of Kushaiguda area, Ranga Reddy district, Andhra Pradesh, India
The quality assessment is made through the estimation of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, CO3 2–, HCO3 –, Cl–, SO4 2–, EC, TDS, TH and pH in the Kushaiguda area Ranga Reddy District, Andhra Pradesh, India. Based on these analyses, parameters like sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate and magnesium hazard were calculated. Sodium adsorption ratio is shown 69% of groundwater is belongs to S3C1, indicating high salinity and low alkali water and based on the Na% with 37.5% for groundwater falls in good to permissible category. Residual sodium carbonate values suggesting safe to marginally suitable category for irrigation purposes. The overall quality of water in the study area in Kushaiguda area Ranga Reddy District, Andhra Pradesh, is high for all constituents ruling out pollution from extraneous source.
