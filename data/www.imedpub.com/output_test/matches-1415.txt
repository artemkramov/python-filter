Length-weight relationship of lionfish Pterois mombasae (Smith, 1957) and spine used as biomedical agent from Parangipettai coast, Tamilnadu, India
Length–weight relationship of Pterois mombasae collected from Mudalsaloodai landing centre, Parangipettai coast, Tamilnadu, India was investigated. In addition to this, morphometric characters also attempted. In the present investigation sample collected from January, 2012 to June, 2012 using long line, gillnet and hand line through commercial vessels. The mean size ranged from 1.8±0.05cm to 19.03±0.02 cm and weight range from 10.3±0.15g to 341±0.57g. Linear regression analysis was also executed to study the length-weight relationship (W=aLb); the ‘r’ value for the lionfish from this region was found to be 0.647. Microscopic observation reveals that the entire spine is enveloped with epithelial tissues, with distinct pigmentation and it is hard and thick. The venomous dorsal spine size ranged from 0.2 to 5.2, pelvic spine size ranged from 0.2 – 1.8cm and anal spine ranged from 1.5 to 0.1
