Incidence of Coagulase positive Staphylococcus in raw camel milk from different regions of India: A possible threat to Diabetic Consumers
Camel milk forms a significant part of tribal diet in arid and semi-arid regions. With the ever-increasing knowledge of its therapeutic value in diabetes and other health concerns, study of indigenous micro flora becomes very important. Staphis reported to be a threat to diabetic patients and immune-compromised people. In the present study 62 raw milk samples were analyzed for incidence of Staphylococcus. Results revealed a high rate of incidence in samples i.e., in 12.9% samples. 62.5% of isolates were coagulase positive whereas, coagulase negative isolates were methicillin resistant. Ciprofloxacin (MIC 1-2 μg/ml) and Imipenem emerged as effective antibiotic drugs for control and Lactobacillus fermentum(MTCC 903) was spotted as an operative probiotic control against these isolates. Statistical analysis of antibiograms showed significant differences in coagulase positive and coagulase negative isolates. Probiotics are emerging as a rapid alternative to antibiotics.
