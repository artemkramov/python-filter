Superparamagnetism and FMR study of Nano Mn-Zn Ferrite
Nanosize particles of mixed ferrite have been prepared by chemical route i.e Sol-gel technique and characterized by FMR and VSM . Resonance linewidth and geff factor with Zn substitution has been discussed. When size of the particles reduces and convert into single domain nanoparticles, transition of ferrites takes place from ferromagnetic to superparamgentic state which was observed due to decrease in remenant magnetization with crystallite size
