Theoretical evaluation of various thermodynamic properties of acrylates with a higher straight chain alknanol at 298.15 K
New experimental thermodynamic data involving density and viscosity of binary liquid mixtures of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate with dodecane-1-ol at temperature 298.15 K and at atmospheric pressure have been measured. These experimental values were correlated by Jouyban-Acree model. These basic parameters further used to evaluate excess molar volume and deviation in viscosity and were fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. Mixture viscosities were correlated by Hind, Choudhary-Katti, Grunberg- Nissan, Tamura and Kurata, Heric-Brewer two body model, McAllister’s three and four body model equations. The calculated values of excess molar volumes were found to be positive and deviations in viscosity were found to be negative for all binary liquid mixtures
