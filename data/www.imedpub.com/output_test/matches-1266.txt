Disturbance of flora and vegetation composition of Libya by human impacts: Costal Region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar area as model
The human impacts and their effects on plant vegetation and biodiversity became a field of major interest in the last few years. many of human activities occurred in AL-jabal AL-akhdar area as result of increase of development activities and growth of population. The present investigation was carried out to study the flora and vegetation composition of coastal region of AL-jabal AL-akhdar area and the effects of human impacts on the vegetation composition. The results showed that 104 plant species belonging to 37 families were found. On the family level, both Fabaceae and Asteraceae were the major plant families in the area with 16 and 15 species, respectively. The annuals form the huge number of the plants(64.4%), while other life forms of the biological spectrum appeared in different percentages. Negative interactions between human activities (land abuse, charcoal burning, overgrazing…etc.) and vegetation were noticed among the study site. We discussed the relationship between flora and vegetation composition and the role of human activity which cause disturbance for the vegetation cover of the study area
