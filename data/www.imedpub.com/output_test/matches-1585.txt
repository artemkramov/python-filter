Investigation on biomass briquettes as energy source in relation to their calorific values and measurement of their total carbon and elemental contents for efficient biofuel utilization
The relationship between the high heating values (HHV’s) and total elemental hydrogen and carbon contents of fourteen (14) selected biomass briquettes is studied. Analyses of the experimental results shows that, the HHV’s of the biomass tested are not linearly related to their total hydrogen contents but, directly related to their total Carbon contents. HHV’s calculated from emperical correlations using the elemental contents of C, H, N,S and O compared well with that of the American Standard of Testing Materials (ASTM) results and also in good agreement with the widely reported values in the acceptable range of 17-21MJ/Kg. The investigation of the effect of particle size on the HHV’s indicates that finely ground particles (about 125μm) had low calorific values as the grinding resulted in a loss of some heat and made the sample vulnerable to air oxidation
