MHD Peristaltic flow of a Jeffrey fluid in an asymmetric channel with partial slip
In the present note, we have discussed the effects of partial slip on the peristaltic flow of a Jeffrey fluid in an asymmetric channel. The governing equations of motion are simplified using a long wave length approximation. A closed form solution of the momentum equation is obtained by Adomian decomposition method and an exact solution is presented. The expression for pressure rise is calculated using numerical integrations. The graphical results are presented to interpret various physical parameters of interest. The trapping phenomena are also discussed. It is found that the size of the bolus decreases with increasing Hartmann number and Jeffrey material parameter.
