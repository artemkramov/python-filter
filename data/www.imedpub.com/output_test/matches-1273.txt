Elucidation of baseline single stranded DNA breaks in smokersÃ¢ÂÂ Tiruchirappalli, India
Smoking is a major contributing factor enhanced many health problems particularly lung cancer which has a survival percentage of 16.4% which increases the risk of cancer and other diseases in humans and animals. DNA damage is the cause of cancer as it damages the cellular apoptosis system severely that the injured cell cannot kill itself and become cancerous. Tobacco smoke also contains various carcinogens other than polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as traces of radioactive elements. The single – cell agarose electrophoresis (SAGE), popularly known as the Comet assay is a simple, versatile and visually pleasing technique that is widely being used in detecting quantifying DNA damage and repair.
