Assessment of the level of noise produced by sound generating machines in Lapai, Northern Nigeria
An assessment of the level of noise produced by sound generating machines was carried out in Lapai, Niger State. Acoustical measurements were made in fifteen selected areas using a precision sound level meter model 2310 SL, IEC 651 type 2 with serial number 09837849 and factory calibrated with a resolution of 0.1dB. Measurements were made at intervals of 100cm from each source and a total of fifteen (15) machines were investigated to determine the noise generated and its level at each of these distances. Results show that the average ambient noise levels around these machines were lowest for source S3 which had between 46dB at 600cm and 78dB at 100cm and highest for source S5 which had between 94dB at 600cm and 122dB at 100cm.This result indicates that people working around source S5 are more exposed to noise and hence more prone to noise associated health effects. The results in S5 exceed the recommended noise level of 90dB for an 8 hour exposure by OSHA. A confirmatory analysis on annoyance, general discomfort and temporary hearing impairments indicated that people around these areas are already being ignorantly affected by these sources of noise
