Stability of Stratified Rotating Viscoelastic RivlinÃ¢ÂÂEricksen Fluid in The Presence of Variable Magnetic Field
The Rayleigh- Taylor instability of stratified rotating viscoelastic (Rivilin- Ericksen) fluids in the presence of variable magnetic field is considered. Numerically and graphically results show that the presence of magnetic field stabilizes a certain wave- number band, whereas the system is unstable for all wave-numbers in the absence of the magnetic field, rotation and for non- viscoelastic fluid. The wave- number range, for which the potential unstable system gets stabilizing effect, increases with the increase in the magnetic field and decreases with the increase in kinematic viscoelasticity
