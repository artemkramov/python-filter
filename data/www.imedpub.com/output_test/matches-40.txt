Analysis of heavy metals in soil of mechanic workshop in Onitsha metropolis
Soil samples were collected at different areas of mechanic workshops of Onitsha metropolis to assay the presence of heavy metals and their possible effects on eco system. Five areas were selected for analyses using AAS. Results show that sample B (Awada) has the highest Nickel concentration with the value as 0.9055ppm while sample A (Nkpor) has the least 0.4528ppm. For chromium sample E with value (0.8754ppm) &gt; C (0.5081ppm) &gt;B (0.4930ppm) &gt; D (0.3597ppm) &gt; A (0.3119ppm). Lead concentration in sample C was too high, is of the value of 33.2477ppm &gt; 6.1097ppm &gt;5 2793ppm &gt; 3.8260ppm &gt; 3.6036ppm for sample D, E, B and A respectively. Cadmium concentration values in A, E, D, C and B have the value of (0.0868ppm) &gt; (0.0496ppm) &gt; 0.0475ppm) &gt; 0.0368ppm) &gt; (0.0303ppm) respectively. Then for copper, sample C has the highest concentration of (2.0259ppm) &gt; D (1.7485ppm) &gt; E (1.6467ppm) &gt; B (1.0446ppm) &gt; A (6.6851ppm). The high concentrations of these Heavy Metals when compared with the WHO standard for Cu, Cr and NI (0.02), Pb (0.02) and Cd (0.05ppm) indicate danger to human health and other animals in the area.
