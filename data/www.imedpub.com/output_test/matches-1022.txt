Anti-cancerous effect of linoleic acid and conjugated linoleic acid on hepatic cancer cells and histocytic lymphoma cells: In vitro
Conjugated linoleic acid, derivative of linoleic acid has been reported in many in vitro and in vivo studies to have beneficial health effects. However, little information is available on dosage effect of this compound against cancerous cell lines. In this study, we investigated the anti-carcinogenic potential of CLA and LA using tretrazolium dye reduction test against HepG2 and U937 cancerous cell lines. Present study supports the role of both CLA and LA as anti-cancerous agents in preventing cancerous cell proliferation.
