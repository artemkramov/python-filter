Accumulation of heavy metal ions in water, sediment and aquatic weeds: A case study of Sudha Dam, Bhokar, India
The metal pollution in water, sediment and its accumulation in some aquatic weeds of the Sudha dam in Maharashtra (India) was assessed for Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se and Zn. The samples of water, sediment and aquatic weeds were collected at random from different areas of the dam covering all directions. All the samples were analyzed for metal ion concentration using UV-spectrophotometer. The water and sediment samples from the Sudha dam contains considerable amount of the metal ions studied. It has been observed that, in root and leaf all the ions get absorbed, while the extent for each element found different in the parts analyzed. Thus it can be clear that, Typha angustifolia and Vallisneria amricana absorbs heavy metal ions and can be used for minimizing the pollution taking place due to toxic metals from industrial effluents.
