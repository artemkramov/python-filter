Erosion studies under vetiver hedge management in Ibadan, South-Westhern Nigeria
The effects of vetiver grass strips on sediment trapping and soil loss were studied during 2010 raining season. Field studies, conducted on 6% alfisol of loamy sand texture which is susceptible to sealing, allowed the comparison of three situations corresponding to buffer strip widths of 3 and 40 m located at the down slope end of a bare experimental field. This study aimed at comparing the rate of soil loss under vetiver grass strip and non-vetiver hedges. The mean total sediment yield of the control plot was greater (28.76 kg/ha) than those in the vetiver plots. The yield was in the trend of non-vetiver plot &gt; plot 2 &gt; plot 1 &gt; plot 3 (28.76kg/ha &gt; 8.94 kg/ha &gt; 4.09 kg/ha &gt; 3.99 kg/ha respectively). %). Statistical comparison of soil loss among the plots revealed that non-vetiver plot was highly significantly different from the vetiver plots, while vetiver plot 2 was significantly different from vetiver plots 1 and 3 (p &lt; 0.05)
