Microbial chromium degradation: Biological evolution, mitigation and mechanism
Crude shroud/ skin go to the tanners as a by-result of meat industry, which is changed over into worth included calfskin as result of style market. Leather assembling is a concoction methodology of the common organic framework. It utilizes the tremendous amount of water and inorganic and natural chemicals in preparing and in this way releases robust and fluid squanders into the earth. These chemicals found in waste waters are harmful to the environment and their effects on biological system are very hazardous. Microbial metal bioremediation or degradation of CTLSs is found to be an efficient strategy due to its low cost, high efficiency and eco-friendly nature. The aim of this paper is to have a deeper review of the problem of processing various types of wastes generated by the leather industry and other textile or chemical industries; its degradation and utilization methodologies
