Evaluation of the utilization of nursing process and patient outcome in psychiatric nursing: Case study of psychiatric Hospital Rumuigbo, Port Harcourt
The nursing process, upon introduction by North American Nurses Diagnosis Association (NANDA) has proved to be a means of standardizing nursing care and in maintaining professional autonomy. However, despite its benefits, many nurses are yet to fully understand and put to practice the nursing process. This may have led to poor patient care and outcome; and it is the basis for this study which evaluated the utilization of the nursing process and patient outcome at Neuro Psychiatric Hospital Rumuigbo. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire of the Likert type, and analysis of findings was done using percentages and non-parametric statistics t-value. Findings from the study showed that although the trained nurses at the hospital had good theoretical knowledge of the nursing process, they did not apply it in the care of their patients. There are several challenges to this lack of application including inadequate practical knowledge, inadequate staff, work overload, management's inability to provide the needed materials among others. It was recommended that the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria should embark on regular seminars, workshops and symposia focused on practical implementation of the nursing process in Nigeria. Non implementation of the nursing process especially in the psychiatric hospital the study maintained would compound the burden of disease on relations, promote relapse and chronicity.
