Study of intermolecular interaction in binary mixtures of cumene with benzene, toluene and acetone at 308K
The ultrasonic velocity, density and viscosity at 308K have been measured in the binary systems of cumene with Benzene, Toluene and Acetone. From the experimental data various acoustical parameters such as adiabatic compressibility (β), free volume(Vf), Shear relaxation time(τ), free length(Lf) and acoustical impedance (Z) ere calculate. The results are interpreted in terms of molecular interaction between the components of the mixtures.
