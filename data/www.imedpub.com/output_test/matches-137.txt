Excess parameters of glycine in aqueous sodium chloride
The density, viscosity and speed of sound have been measured for the systems (1M NaCl +1M Glycine) at different volume fraction and at different temperatures 298.15, 303.15and 308.15K. The excess acoustic parameters such as excess ultrasonic velocity, excess adiabatic compressibility, excess acoustic impedance, excess intermolecular free length and excess relative association have been calculated for the solution. The results are interpreted in terms of molecular interactions.
