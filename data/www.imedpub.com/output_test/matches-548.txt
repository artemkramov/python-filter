Production, optimization and purification of lipase from Bacillus sp. MPTK 912 isolated from oil mill effluent
Lipases are industrially important enzymes and are produced by a variety of microorganisms. However there are very few studies were reported on the production of these enzymes by microbes using effluent as a source. There have been scarce reports on Bacillus lipase isolated from oil mill effluent and its purification. Different intends such as temperature, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources, effect of metal ions and detergents were optimized for maximum yield of lipase in the present investigation. Lipase produced by the Bacillus sp. MPTK 912 had the optimum pH of 8 and the optimum temperature was found to be 35°C. Glucose and peptone acted as the best carbon and nitrogen sources for lipase activity in the production medium. Fe2+, Mg2+, Triton X-100, Tween esters enhanced lipase production. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography and revealed molecular weight of 66 kDa.
