Effect of Thermal Annealing on Optical and Band gap of chemically deposited Tio2/Fe2o3 Core/shell Oxide Thin Films
Titanium oxide (TiO2) thin film was first deposited on the glass substrate to serve as the core. Then ferrous oxide (Fe2o3) was deposited on the core to form novel core/shell oxide thin film of the form Tio2/Fe2o3 using the simple and easily reproducible chemically deposition method. The deposited films were annealed at 373K and 673K in an oven in order to investigate the effect of thermal annealing on the optical properties and band gap. Optical properties such as the absorption coefficient α, extinction coefficient k, and refractive index n, were determined using the absorbance and transmission measurement from Unico UV-2102 PC Spectrophometer at normal incidence of light in the wavelength range of 200-1200nm. The films displayed transmittance in the VIS-FIR region that range between 5% -45%. From absorbance and transmittance spectra, the band gap energy determined lie in the range of 1.92eV-3.19eV. The structural properties, the optical properties and the wide gap exhibited by the thin films made them good candidate for wide range of applications
