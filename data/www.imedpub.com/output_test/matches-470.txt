Interpretation of Aeromagnetic Anomalies over parts of Upper Benue Trough and Southern Chad Basin, Nigeria
A detailed interpretation of the aeromagnetic data has been carried out over parts of Upper Benue Trough and Southern Chad Basin, Nigeria. The magnetic properties of rock were used to determine the depth to magnetic basement, model prominent magnetic anomaly, determine the basement topography and also determine various temperatures at depth in the study area. Two depth source models were interpreted using Discrete Fourier Transform method. Depth to the deeper magnetic sources ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 km, representing the sedimentary cover in the study area. The depth to the shallower magnetic source model which ranges from 0.5-1.4 km, represents intrusive bodies within the area. Based on the sedimentary thickness of 1.5 - 2.5 km and the temperature at depth of 81-1150C, the possibility of hydrocarbon generation towards the northeastern part of the study area is feasible.
