Evaluation of selected halogen anions for the elongation of Leclanche cellÃ¢ÂÂs lifespan
The determination of the surface area of manganese dioxide was carried out using adsorption from solution method and was found to be 1702.69m2/g. the adsorption of these anions on manganese dioxide is to enhance the lifespan of Leclanche cell. The adsorption method by potentiometric titration was used for different anions at four different concentrations (1M, 0.1M, and 0.01M) of the salt solutions at varied temperatures of 280C, 300C and 320C. The electric surface charge of the anions at various temperatures and concentrations were also determined. The result showed that blending of some anions particularly Cl- with manganese dioxide can improve the lifespan of a cell due to its consistency in higher electric surface charge in all concentrations and temperatures.
