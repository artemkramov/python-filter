Dufour and soret effects on steady MHD free convective flow past a vertical porous plate embedded in a porous medium with chemical reaction, radiation heat generation and viscous dissipation
This paper deals with the effects of heat and mass transfer on two-dimensional steady MHD free convection flow along a vertical porous plate embedded in porous medium in presence of thermal radiation, heat generation, viscous dissipation and chemical reaction under the influence of Dufour and Soret effects. The resulting momentum, energy and concentration equations are then made similar by introducing the usual similarity transformations. These similar equations are then solved numerically by using the shooting method along with fourth – order Runge- Kutta integration scheme. Comparison with previously published work is obtained and good agreement is found. The effects of various parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature and concentration profiles as well as the local values of the skin-friction coefficient, Nussel number and Sherwood number are displayed graphically and in tabular form.
