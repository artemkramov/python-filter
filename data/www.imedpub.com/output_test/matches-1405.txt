A study on larvivorous fish species efficacy of lower Manair dam at Karimnagar, Andhra Pradesh, India
Present study was carried out to determine the larvivorous activity of fishes was found in Lower Manair Dam to identify the potential fish species for consuming larval forms. The listed 58 larvivorous potential fish species were collected and identified in the laboratory based on the morphometric and meristimatic characters. Pelagic feeders occupy 25.59%, bentho pelagic feeders occupy 24.14%, demersal feeders occupy 43.10% and feeding of all substrata occupies 05.17%. Only 22 species of larvivorous fishes are consuming mosquito larvae effectively and contributed to 37.93% in the total population. Within the individual orders Perciformes contributed to 66.67%, Cypiniformies contributed to 52% and Beloiniformes contributed to 50%. Most of the species have a high larvivorous potential at early stages, hence these are the feasible in controlling reservoir larval forms. The common name, local name, IUCN (2013.2) and CAMP (1998) conservation status of each fish was listed
