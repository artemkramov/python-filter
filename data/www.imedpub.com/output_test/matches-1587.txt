Structural and mechanical studies of sodium p-nitro phenolate para nitro phenol dihydrate (SPPD) single crystals
Sodium p-nitro phenolate para nitro phenol dihydrate (SPPD) is a semi organic nonlinear optical (NLO) material used for frequency doubling in IR region. It has been synthesized in room temperature. Lattice parameter and structural parameters have been determined by the single and powder X-ray diffraction method. Mechanical studies has also been studied which found that the material is a soft material and by photoconductivity studies it is confirmed that the material exhibit positive photoconductivity
