Evaluation the effect of sucrose and GA3 treatment on vase life carnation cut flower (Dianthus caryophyilus var Yellow)
This study investigated the effects of sucrose and GA3 treatments on the longevity of cut carnation flowers Dianthus caryophyilus var Yellow, respectively. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design (CRD) with two factors and three levels of sucrose (0, 0.5 and 1%) and GA3 at four levels (0, 3, 6 and 9 mg/L) in three replications. Several traits such as longevity rate, diameter of flower, petals color, and relative water content, pH, and electrolyte leakage was measured. The results showed that 6 mg/L GA3 and sucrose had a significant difference compared to the control. Longevity has increased (67.3%) than controls (1%).
