Heat Transfer in an Ionized Hydro Magnetic Slip-Flo between Parallel Walls in a Rotating System with Hall Effect
An attempt has been made to examine the temperature distribution due to MHD flow of an ionized gas between two parallel walls in a rotating frame of reference under the slip-flow regime by taking Hall currents in to account. Analytical solutions for temperature distribution and rate of heat transfer at the walls by the dimensionless Nusselt numbers have been obtained for two cases, that is, when the walls have been made up of (i) non-conducting and (ii) conducting materials. The temperature profiles have been plotted for different sets of values of the governing parameters involved to discuss the behavior of heat transport. It has been observed that, the temperature distribution decreases as the Hall parameter increases for fixed values of Hartmann number, rotation and slip parameters. Also, the temperature distribution has been found to decrease as Taylor number increases in case of non-conducting walls.
