Rational design of hollow core planks for fire resistance
The utilization of precast hollow core plank systems in multi-storey buildings is prevalent these days. This is due to small onsite labour cost and high quality control. Precast hollow core planks are most extensively known for providing economical, efficient floor and roof systems. When properly matched for alignment, the voids in a hollow core planks may perhaps be utilized for electrical or mechanical runs. Among different precast plank systems, prestressed hollow core planks are the most well accepted system because of their lightweight nature and the economical use of concrete. Yet the structural behaviour of such systems under fire exposure is not clear-cut to be predicted because of the complex geometry, composite construction and an extensive range of possible support conditions. The aim of this paper is to discuss the characteristics of hollow core planks and the advantages of this system. Additionally, evaluation on the requirements and recommendations to the fire design of concrete planks from different standards will also be presented. These requirements will form the framework of future research focuses on providing a new method for the fire design of structures with hollowcore concrete plank systems
