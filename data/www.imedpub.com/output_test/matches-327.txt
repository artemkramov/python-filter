Production and microstructural analysis of as-cast and heat treated aluminium alloy, (Al-20%wtMg)
As technology advances, the need for lightweight materials for equipments, aircrafts, vehicles and space stations, has become imperative. In view of this, Microstructural analysis of aluminium alloys becomes very essential in establishment of their physical properties. 16 samples were cast and heat treated at 450oC for 1 hr, after which the samples were annealed, and quenched in water and used engine oil. Tensile, fatigue and hardness tests were carried out on the samples (Using ASTMB557, E466 and E10 respectively). Microstructural analysis was effected using metallurgical microscope with magnification of 400x and digital camera attachment. The samples were characterized by hardness of 59.8, 60.5, 69.1 and 79.6 BHN for as-cast, annealed, used engine oil quenched and water quenched samples respectively. The results show that the hardness increased with increasing quench severity. When the samples were subjected to 3.924, 7.848 and 11.772 Nm, the yield at varying stresses, and number of cycles for each of the samples, the ultimate tensile strength observed were 115.159, 77.057, 70.772 and 61.164 MN/m2 which increased with decreasing quench severity of quench media. The microstructure showed the presence of pores and magnesium grains validating the fact that aluminium and magnesium generate pores during casting.
