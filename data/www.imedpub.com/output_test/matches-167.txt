A report on mass landings of economically important fish along the South East Coast of India
Mass landings were observed in certain species in the month of March and September along the South East coast of India. The mass landings indicate the seasonal abundance of certain species of fish, which are economically important. These fishes seem to be available at a specific season. Thus the following data may help fishery processing units to be aware of the resource available and thus help in the productive usage of fish stock that are caught during the month of March.
