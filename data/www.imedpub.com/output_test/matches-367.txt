Synthesis and Characterization of Hydrophobic PbS Thin Films
In this article, structural, optical, electrical transport and wettabilty studies of PbS thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis have been investigated. The as deposited PbS films exhibit cubic crystal structure. The optical studies revealed a high absorption coefficient (104-105 /cm). The dc electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power were measured by two probe method. The wettability test shows hydrophobic behaviour of PbS thin films.
