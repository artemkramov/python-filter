Effects of wall properties and heat transfer on the peristaltic transport of a jeffrey fluid in a channel
A mathematical model is constructed to study the effect of heat transfer and elasticity of flexible walls in swallowing of food bolus through the oesophagus. The food bolus is supposed to be Jeffrey fluid and the geometry of wall surface of oesophagus is considered as peristaltic wave. The expressions for temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and stream function are obtained under the assumptions of low Reynolds number and long wavelength. The effects of thermal conductivity, Grashof number, rigidity, stiffness of the wall and viscous damping force parameters on velocity, temperature and stream function have been studied. It is noticed that increase in thermal conductivityb , Grashof number Gr and the Jeffrey parameter 1l results in increase of velocity distribution. It is found that that the size of the trapped bolus increases with increase 1l .
