Xanthan sulfuric acid: An efficient biodegradable solid acid catalyst for the synthesis of 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,i]xanthene-8,13-diones
Xanthan sulfuric acid (XSA) is employed as a recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of 14-Aryl-14Hdibenzo[ a,i]xanthene-8,13-diones. These syntheses were performed by the condensation of 2-hydroxynaphthalene- 1,4-dione, aromatic aldehydes and 2-naphthol. This methodology is mild, high yielding, green and the catalyst could be easily recycled.
