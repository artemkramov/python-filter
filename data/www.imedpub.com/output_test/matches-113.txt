Soil samples collected from different locations of the orange belt. The availability of nitrogen according to alkaline permanganate method and phosphorus by olsens method was found to be 243 – 287 Kg/Hector and 13.2 - 15.3 Kg/Hector respectively. Potassium was found to be in medium rang. Organic carbon as a measure of available Nitrogen found to be 0.5 %. The data reveals that the soils are rich with K, medium with P and low with N
