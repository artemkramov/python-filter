Synthesis of nano sized TiO2 and its application in photocatalytic removal of methylene blue
This paper deals with removal of color from waste water of dyeing and textile industry by using nanosized semiconductor photocatalyst TiO2. Photodegradation study is carried out on methylene blue. The TiO2 nano particles were synthesized via Sol-gel route from precursors TiCl4 and ethanol. The effects of various parameters like initial concentration of dye, concentration of catalyst, pH, and contact time have been studied. The attempt has been made to develop more faster and economical removal of methylene blue dye from aqueous solution. The material is analyzed by FTIR and XRD techniques
