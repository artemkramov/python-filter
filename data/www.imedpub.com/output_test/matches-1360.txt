Effect of triangular perforation orientation on the heat transfer augmentation from a fin subjected to natural convection
This study examined heat transfer enhancement from a horizontal rectangular fin embedded with triangular perforation under natural convection compared to equivalent solid fin. The parameters considered were geometrical dimensions and orientation of the perforations. The study considered the gain in fin area and extent of heat transfer enhancement due to perforations. It was found that the heat dissipation from the perforated fin for certain range of perforation dimension can result in improvement in heat transfer over the equivalent solid fin, and the heat transfer enhancement of the triangular perforation that its base is parallel to the fin side (Triangle 3) is the highest
