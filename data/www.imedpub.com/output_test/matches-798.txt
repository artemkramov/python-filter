A review on recent advances in proton exchange membrane fuel cells: Materials, technology and applications
Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFCs) has acquired importance as a promising technology due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells involves the conversion of the chemical energy stored in fuel cell to electrical energy with minimal or no pollution. It has the ability to reduce the energy usage and dependence on the conventional fuels like fossils. During last few years, a great effort has been made in the field of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell technology. There are many challenges to be overcome for the commercialization of fuel cells for traditional energy systems, regardless of the promising achievements and reasonable prospects of PEMFCs. An effective PEM must exhibit high proton conductivity, good mechanical and thermal stability, low electro-osmotic drag coefficient and most importantly must be of low cost. This paper gives an overview of the recent advancements in the development of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel cells, which will operate at both elevated as well as at low temperatures
