Extraction of Sb (III) and Co (II) from Hydrochloric Acid Solutions by N,N-Dioctyl-1-Octanamine in Methyl Isobutyl Ketone
Amines as organic molecules are able to form complexes with metals ions and this is the reason why we can use them to extract metals ions from hydrometallurgical solutions. Based on that, we have investigated the extraction of antimony and cobalt with N,N-dioctyl-1-octanamine from the mixture of elements prepared in artificial manner. We investigated the influence of HCl concentration and concentration of the salts (NaCl, NaI and CH3COONa) in extraction of two elements (antimony and cobalt) from water solutions. All extractions were done from water solutions of HCl with concentrations 3, 6 and 9 mol L-1 and in presence of NaCl, NaI and CH3COONa salts, Extraction of antimony from NaCl solution range from 80-100 %, from NaI solution 100 % and from CH3COONa solution 8.0 -100 %. Extraction of cobalt from NaCl solution move from 4.0-50.0 %, from NaI solution 0-25.0 % and from CH3COONa solution 0-40.0 %. As optimal condition to separate antimony from cobalt is the extraction of antimony from HCl solution with concentration 3 mol L-1 in presence of NaI. Using these condition 100 % of antimony was in organic phase and all of cobalt remains in water phase
