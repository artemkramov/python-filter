The study of electrical conductivity and magneto potential records on gold containing (G-3 and G-4) minerals of Bundelkhand under MRF-excitations
Gold bearing minerals samples from Hansra village, Lalitpur district (U.P), of Bundelkand region. The electrical conductivity and transverse magneto-potential had been recorded under radio-frequency and various physical parameters had been computed. These geo-rocks (G-3 &amp; G-4) sample seems to be synthetic metals and also shows semiconducting characteristics under MRF- switching. The RF- processing of rooks has been used in Solid State Nuclear Track Detector (SSNTDs), photo-sensor, detector, optoelectronic component and one superior alternate to the resent microwave energy interaction approaches for advance material with improved micro-structure
