Mega-watt-hour consumption for vehicle production in Nigeria
Energy supply from the grid is grossly inadequate and the rising cost per kWh is a challenge for the declining industrial operations, particularly the automobile sector of a developing economy. Mega-Watt-Hour consumption per product is a critical indicator of developmental status. The energy supply and utilization characteristic of vehicle manufacturing in Nigeria was assessed. The leading car manufacturer electricity situation on energy consumption from grid and self generation for 11 years was evaluated as a case in reference. The study involved analysis of secondary data that was instructional to the exploratory design for primary data collation and analysis. The results obtained were synthesized and graphically presented using Micro-Soft Excel program. The study established a power demand of 3.48MW and average annual consumption of 4,883.10MWh in the company. Also, 30.19% of consumed energy was met from self generation using diesel generators in agreement with national indicators. An average specific electrical energy consumption of 1.26MWh per Sedan vehicle was established for the normal production years. Electrical energy demand for the future can be projected there-from.
