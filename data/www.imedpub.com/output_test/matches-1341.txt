Evaluation of the physico-chemical properties of twelve D. rotundata land races grown in south-east agro-ecology
This study was aimed at characterizing twelve land races of D. rotundata tubers (namely: Ameh, Ekpe, Okpani, Jiaga, Adaka, Nwokpoko, Miyango, Gwari, Aloshi, Hembakwase, Giwa and Dan Jaling) in terms of their physicochemical properties and textural quality of pounded yams made from them. The yam samples were analysed for their physico-chemical properties such as dry matter, starch, amylose, amylopectin contents, water and oil absorption capacity, swelling index, bulk density and gelatinization temperature which were determined using standard analytical methods. Pounded yam produced from the yam varieties were assessed by a panel of 20 judges for colour, smoothness, elasticity, mouldability and general acceptability. The results showed that there were significant differences in the physico-chemical properties of the different varieties. Ameh had the highest dry matter content of 42%, starch yield ranged from 16.40% for Jiaga to 26.34% for Ekpe. The amylose content ranged from 14.56% for Hembakwase to 32.72% for Okpani. The yam flours had high bulk densities ranging from 0.706 for Giwa to 1.05g/cm3 for Jiaga. Hembakwase had the highest swelling index (2.44). Pounded yam produced from Hembakwase was the most preferred of the twelve landraces investigated. Most D. rotundata landraces have very good functional properties which can be explored for different food formulations
