Glass-grade calcite resources of Borra area, Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh, India
Carbonate rocks are often of economic importance depending on their CaO content. A calcareous rock containing CaO &gt;52%is predominantly calcareous andis considered as high-grade ore for various industrial purposes. A deposit in Andhra Pradesh, Borra area is endowed with such high-grade resources of crystalline carbonatite, in view of their utility in glass industry, is presented in this paper. Analytical results of 10 samples from this area, show that these carbonatite/calcite resources contain an average of 53% CaO and are very well suitable as raw material not only in in glass industry but also in others. A systematic investigation to estimate the resources and proper environment- friendly mining is indeed necessary.
