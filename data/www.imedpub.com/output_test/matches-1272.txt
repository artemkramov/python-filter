Could edaphic factors be at origin of Cedrus atlantica (Manetti, 1844) decay in the National Park of Theniet El Had (Northern Algeria)?
The authors have explored the relations existing between rate decay of three Atlas Cedar Cedrus atlantica districts at level of National Park of Theniet El had in north of Algeria, during sylvan campaign 2009/2010. District which represents the most important decay’s rate among the three ones, is “Guerouaou” district with 11.23% followed by “Tourssout” with a rate equal to 10.08% and “Pépinière” district with a rate equal to 0.73%. Decay presents a strong correlation with pH Kcl.
