Proximate composition, mineral elements, anti-nutrients (toxicants) and lipid characteristics were determined for almond (Terminalia catappa) seeds. The results obtained showed the proximate composition of 25.23% moisture; 5.00% ash; 32.73% lipid; 33.66% crude fibre; 3.11% crude protein; 25.47% carbohydrate and caloric value 534.200 kcal. Mineral elements determined were P, Na, K, Fe, Mg and Ca, while the anti-nutrients evaluated were hydrogen cyanide, oxalate and tannin. Almond seed oil was also characterized. The chemical properties of the oil showed that the oil contain high saponification value with low iodine value, hence the oil is not recommended for soap making but is recommended for cosmetics industries.
