Bioaccumulation of some Heavy Metals in the selected five freshwater fish from Kollidam River, Tamilnadu, India
The Five fresh water fish species of Mystus vittatus, Tilapia mossambica Heteropneustus fossilis, Ctenopharyngodon idella and Saurida undosquamis were caught from Kollidam River, Nagai District, Tamilnadu between the periods of May 2010 to October 2010. The fish organs like liver, gill, Intestine, Kidney and Muscle from the five freshwater fish were carefully dissected for determination of heavy metals like copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and chromium. The levels of heavy metals were determined using ELICO’s SL-176 double beam Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The result shows the copper concentration were the maximum levels followed by Cd &gt; Pb &gt; Cr &gt; Zn. The highest level of copper was observed in liver tissue of Saurida undosquamis. The lowest level of zinc was observed in muscle tissue of Saurida undosquamis. These levels of heavy metals accumulated by the five freshwater fish species might be due to the increase in agricultural influx waters and some anthropogenic activities.
