Antimicrobial sensitivity of gram negative bacteria isolated from recurrent pyoderma in dogs
Gram negative bacteria were isolated from the dogs with recurrent pyoderma along with staphylococci and subjected to antibiotic sensitivity test. Four isolates of Pseudomonas were sensitive only to enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin and gentamicin. Similarly, the eight isolates of Klebsiella were susceptible to cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime with clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin with sulbactum, gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Hundred per cent sensitivity was exhibited by cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime with clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin with sulbactum, gentamicin and amikacin against E.coli. All the isolates were sensitive to enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and resistant to cephalexin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, lincomycin
