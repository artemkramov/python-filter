ResidentsÃ¢ÂÂ perception of the built environment quality in an orphanage
The perception of residents’ on the quality of the built environment in an orphanage was studied. The focus was on the Kumasi Childrens’ home in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Through a combination of different research methods, residential, educational and recreational facilities of the Childrens’ home were analysed. The interview results showed high satisfaction with the available services on the part of both the children and the adults. However, the researcher’s observation was that some of the aspects of the built environment rated positive (good) by the children could not be justified. Nevertheless, all the other aspects of the interviews were in line with the Childrens’ perception (good or satisfying). It is recommended that the design of future orphanages should consider the perception of residents’ especially the children in order to provide facilities that will be useful and promote excellent growth in the children.
