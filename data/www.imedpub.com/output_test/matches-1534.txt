Human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in Odisha: A hospital-based study
xOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the top ten diseases world-wide and a major cause of death in India. In the present study it is found that OSCC is a serious health hazard which is increasing day by day in Odisha. The prevalence of maximum number of patients in Stage-III (42.7 % in male and 50.0% in female) as well as in the age group of 50-69 years (41.5% in male and 66.6% in female) were of great significance to public health. Carcinoma of buccal (cheek) mucosa was observed to be more (45.2% in male and 48.2% in female) than other sites of the buccal cavity is probably due to the habit of keeping smokeless tobacco (oral snuff and khaini), chewing of paan or betel quid, paan masala and gutkha for longer time. In addition to that smoking of bidi and cigarettes as well as drinking of alcohol were found to be strongly carcinogenic among the people of Odisha. This problem needs to be addressed immediately by banning of tobacco, tobacco products and alcohol. Also, incidence of oral carcinoma in non-addicted individuals needs special attention and further research.
