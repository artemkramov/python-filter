Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles from Punica granatum L. and Its Antimicrobial Activity
Green synthesis of nanoparticles was done from Punica granatum L. by using Silver nitrate (AgNO3) from the exocarp, mesocarp and the juice of Aarakta, a local variety of Maharashtra, India. In this work, we have explored an inventive contribution for synthesis of silver nanoparticles using the peel (exocarp and mesocarp) and the seed juice of pomegranates. The procedures for development of stable silver nanoparticles were characterized. The synthesis of nanoparticles was confirmed through UV-Visible spectroscopy. The interaction between nanoparticles with functional groups was confirmed by using FT-IR and PCA was performed. The antimicrobial activity of these pomegranate synthesized silver nanoparticles was evaluated against different microorganisms viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris. Out of the three microorganisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be sensitive for the extractions of pomegranate and formed the antibiotic zones nearer to standard antibiotic, Ampicillin at a quantity of 40 μl per sample. From this study it is clear that, pomegranate nanoparticles can be used as potential antibacterial agents in future therapeutics.
