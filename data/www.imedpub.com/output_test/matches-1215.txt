Extraction and separation studies of platinum(iv) with 4-(4-methoxybenzylideneimino)-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol in hydrochloric acid medium
A novel method is proposed for the extraction of microgram level concentration of platinum(IV) from hydrochloric acid medium with 4-(4-methoxybenzylideneimino)-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol(MBIMTT) dissolved in chloroform as an extractant. The platinum(IV) from the organic phase is stripped with water and estimated spectrophotometrically with stannous chloride. The effect of acid, reagent concentration and various foreign ions has been investigated. The method affords the binary separation and determination of platinum(IV) from the alloys and synthetic mixture. The method is highly selective, simple and reproducible.
