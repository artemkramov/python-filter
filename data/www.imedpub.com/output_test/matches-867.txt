Boron in Soil and Water Samples in some Tea Garden Belt of Golaghat district, Assam
Boron is none uniformly distributed, ubiquitous essential micronutrient element for plant as well as human beings. Extensive use of agrochemicals in soil as well as various natural processes increases the boron concentration in soil and water. Significant risks for human and plant health may results from exposure to non toxic boron contaminants from drinking water, so is important to monitor it. A study has carried out to investigate the level of boron in 15 underground drinking water samples in addition to other physico-parameters (pH, Electrical Conductance, Ca, Mg, Na, K, NO3 - and HCO3 -) from three tea garden belt areas of Golaghat district of Assam, India. Fifteen surface soil samples also analysed for pH, EC, BD, WHC and porosity. The study reveals that five water samples have boron concentration slight higher than the WHO limit. The study further reveals that 10 surface soil samples have boron below detection limit. It may be due to higher leaching of boron during monsoon rains from surface soils beyond the root zone. The presence of boron in drinking water sources in this area is of anthropogenic origin. Thus, there is possibility of severe pollution problem with boron in near future.
