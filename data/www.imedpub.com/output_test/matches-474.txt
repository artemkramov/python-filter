Effect of kuvshinski fluid on double-diffusive convection- radiation interaction on unsteady MHD flow over a vertical moving porous plate with heat generation and soret effects
The objective of present problem is to study effect of Kuvshinski fluid on double-diffusive convection- radiation interaction on unsteady MHD flow over a vertical moving porous plate with heat generation and Soret effects. The fluid is considered to be a gray, absorbing emitting but non scattering medium, and the Rosseland approximation is used to describe the radiative heat flux in the energy equation. The plate moves with constant velocity in the direction of fluid flow while the free stream velocity is assumed to follow the exponentially increasing small perturbation law. A uniform magnetic field acts perpendicular to the porous surface. The effects of various parameters on the velocity, temperature and concentration fields as well as the skin friction coefficient are presented graphically and in tabulated forms.
