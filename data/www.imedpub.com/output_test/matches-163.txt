Combustion Synthesis of Nanocrystalline Al2O3 Powder using Aluminium Nitrate and Urea as reactantsÃ¢ÂÂinfluence of reactant composition
Combustion synthesis technique for synthesis of Aluminium oxide using urea as fuel and Aluminium Nitrate as an oxidizer is found to be easy &amp; economical route &amp; is able to produce Nano phase alumina powder. In present experiment urea is found to have outstanding potential towards solution combustion. Exothermicity is excellent and exothermic flame temperature increase with increase in oxidizer/ fuel ratio. A well defined crystalline structure and Nano scale particles size found after XRD and SEM analysis. Overall Urea-Nitrate combustion synthesis has an outstanding potential for producing pure Alumina powder. Crystallinity is excellent in case of urea, which leads to use in applications require high strength crystalline material.
