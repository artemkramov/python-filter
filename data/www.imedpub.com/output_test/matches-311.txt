A simple route to polyethers from p-hydroxybenzoic acid
Aryl ethers have been prepared from 1,2-diphenoxy ethane and 1,4-diphenoxy butane. Friedel Craft’s acylation of the phenoxy alkanes with acetic anhydride using anhydrous aluminium chloride as catalyst gave 1,2-bis-(p-acetyl)- phenoxy ethane and 1,4-bis-(p-acetyl)-phenoxy butane in 80% yields. Oxidation of diacetyl compounds with either alkaline potassium permanganate or sodium hypobromide yielded the desired compounds. The acids have been identified as their ethyl esters by comparison with authentic samples prepared by condensing ethyl p-hydroxy benzoate with 1,2-bibromo ethane and 1,4-dibromo butane.
