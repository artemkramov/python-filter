Characterization of bioglass ceramic after addition of fluorine in Na2O-CaO-SiO2 system
Bioactive glass formed on the base sample (Go) of 45S5 system with fluorine additives samples were prepared by melt quenching method. The glassy samples were subjected to DTA for determining temperatures at which phase transition occur. FTTR spectroscopy shed a light on the sorts of compounds, their structure as well as their functional groups. The crystalline nature of samples was confirmed by XRD. The calculation of crystal size Xc revealed that the addition of fluorine as a network modifier didn’t affects the phase formation when the phase Na2CaSi3O8 was formed which is similar to the phase developed within the base sample (Go) the addition of fluorine also caused a shift of the glass transition temperature (Tg ) oC, softening temperature (Ts) oC, and crystallization temperature (Tc) oC to lower values
