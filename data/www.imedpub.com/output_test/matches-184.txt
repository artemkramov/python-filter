Mass transfer effects on radiative MHD flow over a non isothermal stretching sheet embedded in a porous medium
In this paper, we present a study for the steady two dimensional radiative MHD boundary layer flow of an incompressible, viscous, electrically conducting fluid caused by a non-isothermal linearly stretching sheet placed at the bottom of fluid saturated porous medium. The governing system of partial differential equations is converted to ordinary differential equations by using the similarity transformations, which are then solved by shooting method. The dimensionless velocity, temperature and concentration are computed for different thermo physical parameters viz the magnetic parameter, permeability parameter, radiation parameter, wall temperature parameter, Prandtl number and Schmidt number
