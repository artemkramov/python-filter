The objective of the work was to study Adsorption behavior of Baggase-a sugar industry waste for the removal of catiionic dye- Basic Red-12. The equilibrium and kinetic experiments were performed in batch mode. The equilibrium data was fitted with Langmuir and Freundlich models. Several operation variables such as adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial pH, and temperature on the removal of dyes were investigated. The removal efficiency increased with increase in adsorbent dosage. The adsorption process followed pseudo second order kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters like DH°, DS° and DG° were analyzed. The processes were spontaneous for the cationic dye. These results suggests that bagasse is a potential low cost industrial waste for textile industry waste water treatment containing cationic dyes
