Physico-chemical analysis of underground water of Harihara Taluk of Davanagere District, Karnataka, India
Ground water samples were collected from different villages of Harihara taluk (India). These water samples from 25 sampling points of Harihara taluk were analyzed for their physicochemical characteristics. Laboratory tests were performed for the analysis of samples for pH, Hardness, Chloride, Alkalinity, TDS etc. On comparing the results against drinking water quality standards laid by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organization (WHO), it is found that some of the water samples are non-potable for human being due to high concentration of one or the other parameter. The usefulness of these parameters in predicting ground water quality characteristics were discussed. Thus an attempt has been made to find the quality of ground water in and around Harihara taluk, suitable for drinking purposes or not.
