Joint behaviors of a humanoid platform while overcoming an obstacle
This paper represents a gait designing strategy for an anthropomorphic robot to step over an obstacle. The gait is conducted as one of the major requirements to establish an indoor navigation system for a bipedal robot. The strategy is experimented using the BIOLOID humanoid platform and the result represents that the technique is viable to step over an obstacle for that anthropoid without losing its upright position. Overcoming an obstacle for a bipedal system is one of the most critical jobs where the system reaches to the most unstable condition. Designing such a critical gait involves a number of complex analysis procedures including the Forward and Inverse Kinematics (FK and IK) formulations. For this project the FK and IK analysis is completed using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) representation technique and Geometric-Trigonometric (G-T) formulation respectively. The paper mainly focuses on the gait designing strategy based on CoP-CoM tracking technique. The paper also demonstrates the various joint demeanor patterns of the 18 DoF BIOLOID system while executing the gait.
