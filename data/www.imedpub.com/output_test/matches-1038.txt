Preparation, Surface-Active Properties and Antimicrobial Activities of Gemini Surfactants based on Morpholine and Piperidine
A novel class of ester functionalized cationic gemini surfactants 4,4'-((ethane-1,2-diylbis(oxy))bis(2-oxoethane- 2,1-diyl))bis(4-(alkoxy2-hydroxypropyl)morpholin4-ium) dibromide 5a,b and 1,1'-((ethane-1,2-diylbis(oxy)) bis(2-oxoethane-2,1-diyl))bis(1-(alkoxy2-hydroxypropyl)piperidin1-ium) dibromide 6a,b were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR,1HNMR and elemental analysis . The surface activity property of prepared surfactants was investigated by surface tension method. A series of surface active parameters, including CMC, Γmax, pC20, CMC/ C20, Amin, γCMC and ÃÂ¿ were obtained from surface measurement. The surface properties of these piperidinium and morpholinium surfactants have been determined by surface tension method. The CMC values of these surfactants decreases with increase of hydrocarbon chain length. For an identical hydrocarbon chain length, the CMC values obtained for piperidinium (6a,6b) series are smaller than those obtained for morpholinium surfactants (5a,5b). These compounds exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi.
