Electronic and optical character of cobalt doped zinc oxide
Nanoclusters of Cobalt(Co) doped Zinc Oxide(ZnO) are chemically synthesized following natural self assembling in Sol-Gel process. The biopolymer is chosen as a base matrix due to a rigid perfect capping of nano-clusters. The resulting specimen was examined by Fourier Transformed Infra red (TIR) Spectroscopy and optical absorption using UV-VIS spectroscopy. The study also includes DC I-V characteristics and conductivity analysis of solid specimen at room temperature. Magnetism in the developed specimens was investigated at room temperature. In all the cases the developed specimens are amorphous in nature and exist with stable quantum confinement. The developed Co doped ZnO was found to behave as semiconductor with large indirect band gap.
