Immobilization of partially purified alpha-amylase enzyme produced by a soil born Bacillus sp.
Alpha amylases have various applications in different industries. Immobilization of alpha -amylase produced by a strain of Bacillus sp isolated from soil of Dibrugarh District of Assam, India was studied. Partially purified enzyme with 4062.62U/ml activity was used for immobilization study. 4% Sodium alginate was used for immobilization of enzyme and the optimum temperature, pH and incubation period for immobilized alpha amylase enzyme were 60°C, 6.0 and 10minutes, respectively. The immobilized enzyme was very effective in reducing starch viscosity and the immobilized enzyme was found to be stable. Activity yield was 86.39%. This immobilized enzyme can be used commercially as a replacement of free enzyme because it has shown greater operational flexibility and higher enzymatic activity.
