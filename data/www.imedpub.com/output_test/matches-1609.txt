Seasonal variations of hydro-chemistry in certain ephemeral streams in a tropical climate, northeastern India
This paper present to study of the physico-chemical parameters of Baghjan, Singijan and Ghagorbasti, three freshwater ephemeral streams of Lakhimpur District of Assam. Seasonal changes in physical and chemical parameters such as Temperature, Depth, Width Dissolved Oxygen, Free CO2, Total acidity, Total alkalinity, Chloride, , pH, were analyzed for a period of one year from September 2011 to August 2012.
