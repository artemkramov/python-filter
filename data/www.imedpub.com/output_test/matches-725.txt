Study of physicochemical and biological characteristics of lakes from Shivaji University Campus, Kolhapur, Maharashtra
Pollution of water bodies is one of the areas of major concern to environmentalists. For the present study, water samples were collected from three different lakes from Shivaji University campus, Kolhapur. Monthly changes in physical and chemical parameters such as Temperature, Transparency, Turbidity, Total Dissolved Solids, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Free Carbon dioxide, Total Hardness, Chlorides, Alkalinity, Phosphate, Nitrates and MPN were analyzed for a period from September 2010 to February 2011. All parameters were within the permissible limits except BOD, COD and phosphates. The results indicate that the Rajaram Lake was more contaminated than remaining two lakes of Shivaji University campus, due to various anthropogenic activities
