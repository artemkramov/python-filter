Soret and Dufour Effects on Double-Diffusive Heat Transfer Flow in a Rectangular Duct with Radiation Absorption and Non-linear Density-Temperature Relation
We analyze the effect of magnetic field on convective heat and mass transfer flow of a viscous electrically-conducting fluid through a porous medium in a rectangular duct with Soret, Dufour, chemical reaction, and thermal radiation effects. The equations governing the flow, heat and mass transfer are solved by employing the Galerkin Finite element analysis with tri-nodal triangular elements. The temperature and concentration distributions are analyzed for different values of M, Q, Rad, S0, Du and g. The rates of heat and mass transfer are evaluated numerically for different parametric values. The numerical results obtained in the present paper are validated by favorable comparison with previous published results.
