Combined effects of Hall currents and radiation on MHD free convective Couette flow in a rotating system
Effects of Hall currents and radiation on MHD free convection of a viscous incompressible fluid confined between two vertical walls in a rotating system have been studied. We have considered the flow due to the impulsive as well as accelerated motion of one of the walls. The governing equations are solved analytically using the Laplace transform technique. The variations of the fluid velocity components and the fluid temperature are presented graphically. It is found that the velocity components decrease near the moving wall and increase away from the moving wall for both the impulsive as well as the accelerated motion of one of the walls with an increase in Hall parameter. There is an enhancement in fluid temperature as time progresses. The absolute value of the shear stresses at the moving wall due to the primary and the secondary flows for both the impulsive as well as the accelerated motion increase with an increase in either rotation parameter or radiation parameter. The rate of heat transfer at the moving wall increases with an increase in radiation parameter.
