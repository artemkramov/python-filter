Preliminary phytochemical screening and antibacterial of Cardiospermum halicacabum L.
The present investigation of crude extracts from leaf, seed coat and stem of cardiospermum halicacabum L. in different solvent, were subjected to phytochemical and antibacterial screening against the selected Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The phytochemical solvent extracts were used for screening and antibacterial activity, were analysed. The Phytochemical studies indicate that the leaf, seed coat and stem contain a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites. Flavonoid, Terpenoids and cardiac glylosides were predominantly found in all the three tested solvent extracts of leaf followed by Tannin, Flavonoid, Terpenoids and cardiac glylosides (Acetone, Chloroform and Diethyl ether). Likewise, Tannins, Flavonoid, Terpenoids and cardiac glylosides and anthrquinonus were predominantly found in all the tested solvent extracts of the stem. Then seed coat followed by Tannins, Flavonoids and Terpenioids were predominantly found in all the tested solvent in plant extracts. Saponins were not found in any of the solvent extract of stem, leaf and seed coat. All the extracts showed varying degree of inhibitory potential against all the tested bacteria. (Acetone, Chloroform and Diethyl ether) extracts of seed coat had higher inhibitory action against Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella respectively. Chloroform extract of stem, leaf and seed coat had moderate inhibitory action against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus.
