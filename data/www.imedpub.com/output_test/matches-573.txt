Optimization and production of itaconic acid using Aspergillus flavus
In the present investigation soil samples were collected from Mallipattinum, Thanjavur (Dt). Different species of fungi were isolated from soil sample. Among these fungi Aspergillus flavus were dominantly present in soil. The itaconic acid activity was measured at different pH and different temperature using Aspergillus flavus. It was found to be maximum at pH 4 and temperature at 40°C in Aspergillus flavus. Itaconic acid is mainly used for stiffening agents made from poly itaconic acid , synthesis of novel biodegradable hydrophilic polymers from itaconic acid derivatives. Itaconic acid is also used in emulsion paints where it improves adhesion of the polymer. It forms copolymers with its esters and other monomers, which are used in the paper industry for wall paper and other paper products. It is also used in the production of adhesives.
