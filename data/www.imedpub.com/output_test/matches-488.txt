Acoustical studies of binary (butanol+benzene), ternary (butanol+methyl benzoate+benzene) mixtures at 303 K
The ultrasonic measurements like ultrasonic velocity, density, and viscosity of the ternary system butanol with methyl benzoate in benzene systems have been measured the whole range of mole fraction at 303K. From the measured values evaluate ultrasonic parameter such as adiabatic compressibility (β), free length (Lf), free volume (Vf) using standard relations also predict the excess parameter. The ultrasonic measurements, acoustical parameter and related excess parameter give the results of the molecular interaction between liquids. These values indicate the specific interaction of the liquid mixtures. The presence of strong dipole- dipole- type interaction was confirmed in theses system.
