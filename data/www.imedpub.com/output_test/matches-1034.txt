Evaluation of fertilizers for ideal growth of Terminalia arjuna and enhancement of economic parameters of Tropical Tasar silkworm Antheraea mylitta drury
Antheraea mylitta drury a Tropical tasar silkworm derives almost all the essential nutrients for its growth from the primary host plant Terminalia arjuna and convert it into animal biomass. A field experiment was conducted for three crops to identify the suitable fertilizer among Urea and NPK(19:19:19) for Terminalia arjuna leaf nutrient levels and Antheraea mylitta drury’s larval and cocoon characters. The treatment comprised of T1- Urea treated plants, T2-NPK treated plants, T3- Untreated plants (Control) and B1-Larvae reared on T1, B2-Larvae reared on T2, B3-Larvae reared on T3.The pooled results indicated that total soluble proteins, free amino acids, total soluble sugars, total reducing sugars and chlorophyll content were recorded maximum in T2. Maximum larval weight ,silk gland weight and minimum larval duration, larval loss were recorded in B2 batch. Cocoon weight, shell weight, shell ratio, filamentlength, reliability, reeled silk weight, denier and cocoon yield were also recorded high in B2 batch cocoons
