Threats and security measures on wireless local area networks
The demands on Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are growing due to the ever increasing proliferation of network devices and applications [14]. The number of devices and connections per user is rapidly on the increase. It is common for most flexible mobile users to have not only primary computing devices but also at least one or more smart devices. However, advent of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and its adoption has made the wireless networking readily available, affordable, and easy to use. Many users use wireless technology for domestic as well as commercial purposes. This use has to take care of certain security threats that may be encountered. This paper analyses those threats and suggests the necessary measures so that both home based and publically situated wireless networks can be well guarded
