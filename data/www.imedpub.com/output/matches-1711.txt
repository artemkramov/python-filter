Thermo-acoustical molecular interaction studies in ternary liquid mixtures using ultrasonic technique at 303K
The ultrasonic studies in liquids are great use in understanding the nature and strength of molecular interaction. The thermo-acoustical parameters for ternary liquids mixtures namely, Chlorobenzene + Benzene + Tetrahydrofuran (THF) have been estimated, from the measured values of ultrasonic velocity (U), density (ρ) and viscosity (η). Using the measured data, some of the acoustical parameters such as, adiabatic compressibility (βa) free length (Lf), free volume (Vf), internal pressure (πi), relaxation time (τ), and Gibb’s free energy (ΔG) are evaluated at the temperature 303K. The present paper represents the nonlinear variation of ultrasonic velocity and the thermo-acoustical parameters lead to dipole- induced dipole interaction between chlorobenzene and benzene molecule while dipole-dipole interaction between the chlorobenzene and THF molecule. The behavior of these parameters with composition of the mixture has been discussed in terms of molecular interaction between the components of the liquids
