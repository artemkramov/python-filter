Indoor radon levels in some dwellings surrounding the National Thermal Power Corporations (NTPCs), India
Fly ash from a thermal power plant is spread and distributed in the surrounding area by air and may be deposited on the soil of the region surrounding the thermal power plant on which the dwellings are constructed. Indoor radon concentration depends on the characteristic of the soil, the type of building structure, ventilation condition and occupant’s behavior. The present study represents the measurements of indoor radon and its progeny concentration in the dwellings constructed in the surroundings of National Thermal Power Corporations (NTPCs) situated at Badarpur (Delhi) and at Dadri, (U.P.) India. LR-115 type-II solid state nuclear track detectors fixed on a thick flat card were exposed in bare mode. Keeping the radiation hazards of radon for general population in mind, the annual effective dose in these dwellings has also been calculated. The results for radon levels and annual effective dose are found to be below the recommended action levels.
