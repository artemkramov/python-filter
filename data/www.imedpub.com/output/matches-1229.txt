Crystal growth and characterization of strontium doped barium tartrate crystals by silica gel method
The single crystals of Strontium doped Barium tartrate crystals were grown by Single diffusion technique, in silica gel at room temperature. Effect of Strontium doping on the Barium tartarate has been studied. The XRD pattern shows that Strontium barium tartarate crystals are polycrystalline, having orthorhombic structure. SEM pictures reveal that crystals are grown by layer deposition. The elemental analysis was done by EDAX. The chemical analysis is done by FTIR to denote the functional group of grown crystal. The thermal stability was studied by the TGA, DTG and DSC
