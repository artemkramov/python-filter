Khasare equation of state for thermodynamic study of some organic liquids using face centered cubic packing density
Using two parametric (h,t) Equation of State, unique cavity in fluid is estimated. The correlation of structural properties and thermodynamic behavior in terms of liquid clusters has been studied. Computations are based on ÃÂ±ÃÂ±ÃÂ±ÃÂ±a new parameter introduced to obtain the unique solution. The upper limit hmax is predefined close to 0.74. All computations are carried at 303.15 K. The value of zÃÂ±ÃÂ±ÃÂ±is attributed to cluster formation. Present calculation is based upon the sample thermodynamic data such as ultrasonic wave, density, volume expansion coefficient and ratio of specific heat (1.3).
