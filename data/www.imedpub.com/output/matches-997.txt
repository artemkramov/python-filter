Corrosion, inhibition and biological evaluation investigations of Schiff bases derived from formyl chromone
Three new schiff bases derived from 3- Formyl chromone with Sulfapyrdazine (K3), 3-formyl-6-methyl chromone with Sulfamethoxeypyrdazine (H3) and 3- formyl-6-methyl chromone with Sulfaproxylene (H4) were Synthesized. The structures were confirmed by IR, 1H and 13CNMR, and EI-mass Spectrometry. Corrosion inhibition of these compound on carbon steel in industrial water have been investigated using weight loss and Tafel polarization methods. The effect of temp. and concentration were investigated. The compounds were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against four types of bacteria which commonly known in oilfield
