Seasonal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of Thengaithittu estuary, Puducherry, South East-Coast of India
All the physico-chemical parameters such as temperature, turbidity, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand and nutrients like ammonia, silicate, nitrate, and nitrite were studied in two selected stations (mouth &amp; mangrove area) Thengaithittu estuary, south-east coast of India for a period of three year (January 2009 – December 2011). Atmospheric temperature varied from 26 to 38.5oC, water temperature 26o C to 35.5o C, turbidity ranges from 4 to 13 NTU, pH varied from 6.8 to 8.4, salinity value ranges from 12 to 32.5 ppt, dissolved oxygen 3.3 to 4.7 mg/l, BOD values of 0.2 to 3.8 mg/l. Concentrations of nutrients viz., ammonia ranges from 0.05 to 0.18μmol/l, reactive silicate varied from 25.5 to 99.0μmol/l, nitrate 0.41 to 6.92μmol/l and nitrite value ranges from 0.090 to 0.78 μmol/l were also shows variations independently throughout the study period
