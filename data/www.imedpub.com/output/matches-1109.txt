Multidisciplinary Approach to the Implications of Generator Sound Energy on the Environment, a case Study of Onitsha
The effect of generator sound on the environment, a case study of Onitsha was considered in this work. 400 copies of questionnaire were randomly administered within Onitsha. The sample was chosen based on population. The issue of social implications of generator sound was discussed. The objective of this work was achieved through this hypothesis; there is no significant difference on the social implications of generator sound in Onitsha. The hypothesis was tested using analysis of variance. The result showed that there is significance difference in the social implication of generator usage in Onitsha. Since, people resort to the use of generator because of the inadequate supply of the conventional Power and generator sound affects environment; it was recommended that government should ensure adequate supply of the conventional power. To ensure proper protection of the environment and economic growth, the study also recommended that governments adopts better strategies through ensuring regular supply of conventional power and the provision of silencer generators for use by the common man
