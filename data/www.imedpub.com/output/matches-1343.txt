Geology and petrography of Adolerite dyke, Hyderabad granitic region, Peninsular India
The 2.5 billion years Hyderabad granitic region (HGR), covering an area of ~ 150 x 150 km over the eastern part of the Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) , is considered as largest granitic pluton of Indian subcontinent. (S.B. Singh, et.al).Region of this batholithic craton is composed with granitic gneisses and unclassified granites. This region was apparently formed due to extensive lower crustal remelting of permobile phases of older (3.3-2.9Ga) gneisses (Divakara Rao, 1996). Dykes of different composition were occurred within the craton. Extension, widthand the crystalinity of these dykes different from one to another. Dykes in this craton are occurred more than hundred kilometers to very small dykes less than few hundred meters in dimension. Most of themare in N-S direction and NESW directions. The present study on the dyke occurred to the east of Hyderabad is an attempt to understand the crystallization history of basic magma
