Study of ornamental fish diversity and water quality of Adda Hole stream, Kabbinale forest range, Western Ghats
Addahole stream belongs to Kabbinale forest of Gundia region. The water quality and ornamental fish diversity were examined. The stream water is fast and slow flowing with clear water and rocky, sandy, leafy substrate. This stream is about 14 kms long, perennial and has different habitats with diverse ornamental fish population. Results revealed the mean values of water quality of all samples collected from different sampling sites were pH 5.50, Water temperature 27.5°C, dissolved oxygen 6.32 mg/l and total dissolved solids 53.06 mg/l. The mean air temperature was 30.3°C. Fish diversity showed presence of twelve different species, belonging to six different families, of which the family Cyprinidae was dominant with Rasboradaniconius and Puntiussps being the most abundant in all seasons. Fish diversity is correlated with physicochemical parameters. The total number of taxa and individuals showed positive correlation with water and air temperature. But it showed negative correlation with dissolved oxygen and positive correlation with total dissolved solids. Shannon-Weaver diversity indices showed positive correlation with air temperature.
