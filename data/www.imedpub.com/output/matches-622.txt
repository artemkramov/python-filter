Studies on nutritional requirements of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for lipase production
A nutritional requirement for the lipase production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was investigated. The bacterial strain was isolated from municipal sewage and it was culture with different nutritional composition. The maximum lipase activity was obtained with maltose as the sole carbon source 6.5 Uml-1, followed by lactose 4.6Uml- 1. The various salts used the best results were observed with calcium chloride 4.6 Uml-1as and sodium chloride an inorganic source. Among the various commercial grade oil highest activity was observed with coconut oil 8.1 Uml-1 and gingili oil 6.8 Uml-1. Amino acids are also play a significant role for the lipase production. The maximum lipase activity was observed with glycine 5.1Uml-1 followed by tryptophan 4.6Uml-1 as a supplement. The organism grows optimally in the temperature of 40oC and pH 8. The strain isolated from the municipal sewage is industrially important from in terms of ability. These findings will be helpful in prospect for increase the production of industrial enzyme.
