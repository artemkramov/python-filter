Polyester Nanocomposite fibers with Antibacterial Properties
Antibacterial nanocomposite polyester (PET) fibres were melt spun by adding nano ZnO loaded Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) master batch (MB) to the PET chips. The influence of content of nano ZnO on the antibacterial properties, crystallization behaviour and mechanical properties was studied. It was found that PET composite fibres having 1 % nano ZnO showed the optimum antibacterial activity. The presence of nano particles advanced the onset of crystallization temperature and also adversely affected the mechanical properties but well within acceptable limit.
