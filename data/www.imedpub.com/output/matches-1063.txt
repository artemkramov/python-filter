Verification of specific refraction and molar refraction for homologous alcohol series at 30ÃÂ°C by suggested formula (PDJ)
Refractive index and Density of Homologous Alcohol series have been studied at 30°C temperature. The data obtained is utilized to determine specific refraction and molar refraction. It compare between Lorenz &amp; Lorentz and PDJ formula for specific refraction and molar refraction. The values of specific refraction and molar refraction are increasing with increase of homologous alcohol series.
