The effect of hygroscopic growth on desert aerosols
In this paper some microphysical and optical properties of desertaerosolswereextracted from OPAC to determine the effect of hygroscopic growth at the spectral range of 0.25μm to 2.5μm and eight relative humidities (RHs) (0, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, 98, and 99%). The microphysical properties extracted were radii, volume mix ratio, number mix ratio and mass mix ratio as a function of RH while the optical properties are scattering and absorption coefficients and asymmetric parameters. Using the microphysical properties, growth factors of the mixtures were determined while using optical properties we determined the enhancement parameters and were then parameterized using some models. We observed that the data fitted the models very well.
