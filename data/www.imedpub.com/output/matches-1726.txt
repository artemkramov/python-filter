Thermosphere wind variation during a magnetically quiet period
The paper presents horizontal wind variation in the relatively magnetic quiet month of September 2003 using wind data from TIMED and CHAMP satellites. Wind behavior in the lower thermosphere is influenced by external forces from the lower atmosphere while solar electromagnetic radiations and magnetospheric electric field act on the upper thermosphere. The upper thermospheric winds from the two local time sectors are observed to be faster than the lower thermospheric winds
