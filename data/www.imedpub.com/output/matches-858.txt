Structural characterization of PMMA blended with chemically synthesized PAni
In the present study, we discuss the synthesis of Polyaniline (PAni (ES)) and its composites with Poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA). PAni doped with Dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) has been synthesized through chemical oxidation of aniline in presence of Ammonium persulphate (APS). Composites of PMMA and PAni have been formed by solution blending method using Chloroform as solvent. The X-ray and FTIR studies reveal the formation of inter-penetration network of PAni Particles with the chain of the PMMA.
