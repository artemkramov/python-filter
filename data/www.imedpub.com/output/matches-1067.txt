Antimicrobial activity of Indian spices against pathogenic bacteria
The present study investigated the antimicrobial potential of four Indian spices viz., black pepper, clove, cinnamon and turmeric against the human pathogenic bacteria. The ethanolic extract of all spices exhibited maximum antimicrobial potential. The ethanolic extract of all spices exhibited maximum antimicrobial potential. The ethanolic extract of clove showed highest potential against E. coli (25.0±0.81mm) while that of black pepper exhibited maximum activity against E. coli (22.3±0.56mm). The ethanolic extract of cinnamon exhibited maximum antibacterial property against E. coli (21.3±0.7mm) while that of turmeric showed highest potential against E. coli (29.3±0.47mm). The spices exhibited effective antimicrobial potential.
