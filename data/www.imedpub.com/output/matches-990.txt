Studies of groundwater quality for irrigation suitability from Muktainagar region, dist. Jalgaon, Maharashtra
The study area under investigation, Muktainagar is located towards eastern part of Jalgaon district in Maharashtra state. The area is lying between 21°03’08” North latitude 76°03’18”East longitudes. This area is facing a problem of water scarcity. In India the water availability, quality and quantity differs. The chemical quality of water is of great importance as it determines the suitability for specific use whether it is for drinking, domestic or for agriculture use. To study the hydrochemical nature of the water used for drinking purpose, a collective 51 samples of ground water were collected during May 2012. Analytical reports were compared with World Health Organization. Ground water from this area is very hard in nature. The qualities of ground water were found to be deteriorated predominantly due to overexploitation and anthropogenic activities. The outcome of this work will be helpful for the local population to understand the qualitative behavior for specific use to create a healthy eco friendly environment among themselves
