Physico-chemical contamination of groundwater in and around Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu
A total of 10 ground water samples were collected from in and around Tirunelveli during the year 2010 were analysed for their physicochemical characteristics. The physicochemical parameter such as pH, Conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+),chloride (Cl-), sulphate (SO4 2-),nitrate (NO3 -),Dissolved oxygen (DO), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analysed. The results were compared with the World Health Organization (WHO 2003) standard values. The quality of ground water samples were discussed with respect to these parameters and thus an attempt was made to ascertain the quality of ground water is fit or not for drinking and other purposes
