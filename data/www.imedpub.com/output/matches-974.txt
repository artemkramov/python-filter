SIQR model for transmission of cholera
In this paper we analyzed SIQR-B model with incidence rate in form of   +     . Compartment Q represents quarantine which is used to separate and restrict the movement of persons; it is a 'state of enforced isolation'. It is often used in connection to disease and illness, such as those who may possibly have been exposed to a communicable disease .By analyzing the corresponding characteristics equations, the local stability of a diseasefree equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium is established. The quarantine reproduction number is obtained
