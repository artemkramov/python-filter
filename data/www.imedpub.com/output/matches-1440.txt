Cryptosporiodiosis in neonatal dairy calves
An overall prevalence of 37.75 % was recorded for bovine cryptosporidiosis on coprological examination of 98 faecal samples collected from neonatal diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic cattle calves from an organized dairy farm in Tirupati by modified Ziehl–Neelsen staining. Further, a gradual decline in the percent prevalence was seen with increase in the age of the host from &lt;1 month (52.45 %) to 2–5 months (13.51 %). Further, prevalence of cryptosporidiosis was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the diarrhoeic calves (78.57 %) as compared to the nondiarrhoeic calves (21.42 %). It is clearly indicating a relatively higher risk of the disease in diarrhoeic than normal calves
