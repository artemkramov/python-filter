Uranium and radon concentration in ground water in Aucashat city (Iraq) and the associated health effects
Uranium and radon gas concentrations in ground water were determined for six locations in Aucashat city using CR-39 track detector. For uranium concentration, fission fragments track technique was used, the nuclear reaction of nuclear fission fragments obtained by the bombardment of 235U with thermal neutrons from (Am-Be) neutron source with flux (5000n.cm-2.s-1). For radon concentration, the natural exposure method using the sealed cup technique, the concentration values were calculated by a comparison with standard samples. The results of the measurements show that the uranium concentration in water samples various from 8.8±0.12 to 12.63±0.19μg/l with an average 10.23±1.3μg/l. For radon concentrations in ground water various from 8.02 ± 0.14 to 11.7±0.16 kBqm-3 with an average 9.35±1.24 kBqm-3, and the annual effective dose from ingestion (stomach) various from 0.84 to 1.23 mSv/y, from inhalation (lung) various from 2.25 to 3.28 mSv/y and for whole body various from 3.09 to 4.51 mSv/y.
