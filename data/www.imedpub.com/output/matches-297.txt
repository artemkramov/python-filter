Finite Element Analysis of Chemical Reaction Effect on Non-Darcy Convective Mixed Convective Double Diffusive Heat Transfer Flow Through a Porous Medium in Vertical Channel with Constant Heat Sources
We analyse the effect of chemical reaction on non-Darcy convective Heat and Mass transfer flow of a viscous electrically conducting fluid through a porous medium in a vertical channel with constant heat sources. The governing equations flow, heat and mass transfer are solved by using Galerkin finite element technique with quadratic polynomial approximations. The approximation solution is written directly as a linear combination of approximation functions with unknown nodal values as coefficients. Secondly, the approximation polynomials are chosen exclusively from the lower order piecewise polynomials restricted to contiguous elements. The velocity, temperature, concentration, shear stress and rate of Heat and Mass transfer are evaluated numerically for different values of G,M,D-1,N,Sc,g and a.
