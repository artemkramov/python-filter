Isolation and identification of bacteria responsible for flacherie in silkworms
The silkworm is the larva or caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth, Bombyx mori. It is an important economic insect since it is a producer of silk. Flacherie is a syndrome associated with bacterial diseases. In the present study diseased silkworms were collected, dissected to separate the contents of foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The samples were serially diluted and from which 10-5, 10-6 dilutions were plated onto nutrient agar plates. The predominant colonies were selected and identification procedures such as colony morphology, staining property and biochemical tests. As a result the organisms identified were Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella cloacae. Hence the study concludes with this bacterial identification which is responsible for bacterial flacherie in silkworms. So if a measure is taken to control these bacterial species the disease incidence in silkworms can be reduced which in turn increase the economics.
