A novel method of using refractive index as a tool for finding the quality of aqueous enzymatic extracted algae oil
Any physical parameter should find applications in our day-to-day life. In this paper, it has been shown that that how the refractive index can be used as a tool for finding the quality of oil. The refractive index of algae oil extracted by different processing condition has been determined and presented here.
