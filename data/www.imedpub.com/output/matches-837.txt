Magnetic and structural properties of Magnesium Zinc Ferrites synthesized at different temperature
The magnetic properties of Mg1-xZnxFe2O4 (where x = 0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6) ferrites have been studied. Magnesium Zinc Ferrites was synthesized by oxalate co-precipitation method at different synthesis temperature and characterized by X-ray diffraction and far IR absorption techniques, scanning Electron microscopy .The lattice parameter were computed . The X-ray diffraction studies reveal the formations of single phase cubic spinel structure.IR absorption bands are observed around 600 cm-1 and 400 cm-1 on the tetrahedral and octahedral sites respectively. Magnetization parameters such as saturation magnetization, and magnetic moment were calculated and the results are discussed with the help of the existing theories. Saturation magnetization was found to be in the range 2 emu/gm to 8.28 emu/gm when the samples were synthesized below 100ºC. The variation of A.C. susceptibility with temperature shows the existence of super paramagnetic nature. The Curie temperature was determined from the measurement of the susceptibility verses temperature. The SEM micrographs shows the uniform distribution of the particles, the average size was estimated to be 0. 350 μm.
