Study of collective bands in 154Gd using IBM-1
Recently 8π spectrometer is used to identify Kπ = 01 +, Kπ = 02 +, Kπ = 21 +, bands of Gadolinium isotope. In this work excited Kπ = 01 +, Kπ = 02 +, Kπ = 21 + bands in 154Gd are studied by using the Interacting Boson Model-1 (IBM-1). It is found that the calculated energy values, B(E2) values and interband B(E2) ratios of 154Gd isotope have reasonable agreement with the experimental energies, B(E2) values and B(E2) ratios.
