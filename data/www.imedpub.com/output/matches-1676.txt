Adsorption of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution by granulated activated carbon from Canarium schweinfurthii seed shell
Activated carbons were prepared from agricultural waste Canaruim schweinfurthii seed shell with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as chemical activation agent. The activated carbons were prepared by carbonization at 5000C for 15minutes. Batch adsorption trials were used to assess the effectiveness of using activated carbon as a sorbent for the removal of hexavalent chromium from solution. Based on linear regression analysts, the data obtained from the batch studies showed a good compliance with both the Langmuir and the Freundlich equations. The values obtained for the isotherm constants showed that the maximum adsorption capacity, Qo was 0.757 mg/g with activated carbon prepared with Phosphoric acid.
