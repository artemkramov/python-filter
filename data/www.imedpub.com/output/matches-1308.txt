A simple, rapid and environmentally benign synthesis of Nalkyl/ aryalkyl benzimidazoles promoted by ultrasound irradiation
A simple, rapid, efficient and environmentally benign route has been developed for the synthesis of Nalkylbenzimidazoles3(a-k) by the reaction of 2-substituted 1H-benzimidazoles 1(a-k) with different alkylating agents 2 using triethanolamine as solvent under ultrasonic irradiation. This method provides several advantages of being completely green, giving high yields, environmentally benign and minimizing the use of hazardous solvents
