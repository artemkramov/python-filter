Determination of organic pollutants in hospital wastewater and food samples within Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (Abuth), Shika, Zaria-Nigeria
Hospital wastewater and food samples (potatoes, cassava and tomatoes) were collected from Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital wastewater Treatment plant, and from farm land respectively, within the vicinity of the research area. Samples were collected within the month of July, 2010. The following organic pollutants were determined, xylene, Methylene chloride, Butylated hydroxyltoluene, Octadecanioc acid and Tetradecene, with the aid of a GC-MS after proper samples treatment and isolation using solvent extraction. Diethyl ether and chloroform were used as organic solvents. All the organic parameters determined were lower than limits set by World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the maximum contaminant levels.
