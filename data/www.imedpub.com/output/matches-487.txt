Behaviour of distributional generalized Fourier Kontorovich- Lebedev Transform
This paper deals with the distributional generalized Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform, transform of distributional function in dual space of W a, b, a FKF i.e. W , ,a ' a b FKF . We have discussed some properties of transform. In this paper we have also extended the properties for analytic behaviour on transform and discussed the results for different dimensions.
