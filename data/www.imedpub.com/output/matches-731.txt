On the effect of rotation on Soret driven double-diffusive stationary convection
The effects of rotation and the mass flux induced by temperature gradient (Soret effect) on the double diffusion convection in a horizontal layer of fluid subjected to thermal and solutal gradients with cross diffusions are investigated analytically and shown graphically. Normal mode technique has been used for the linear stability analysis of the problem. The eigen value problem and the exact solution are obtained for stability investigations. The expression for stationary Rayleigh number is obtained as a function of the governing parameters. The analysis reveals that the Soret parameter and the Lewis number both have the destabilizing effect on the onset of stationary convection in the system while the stable solute gradient and rotation have stabilizing effect on the onset of stationary convection and introduces oscillatory modes in the system, which were non-existent in their absence. In the limiting cases some previous published results have been recovered
