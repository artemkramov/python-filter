Determination of the Dielectric Constant of Pure and Bamboo Carbonated Polymers using the Impedance Method
In this research work, we investigated the dielectric constant of pure and carbonated polymers using the impedance method. In carrying out the research, low density polyethylene (LDPE) and metallocene polyethylene (MPE) were used as the polymers. The main difference between LDPE and MPE is that low density polyethylene is produced by high pressure free-radical polymerization of ethylene while MPE is produced by low pressure polymerization technology using metallocene as catalyst to copolymerize ethylene and another monomer such as butane-1. Bamboo charcoal which serves as the carbon was added to each samples. The dielectric constant of the polymers increased with increased weight of carbon. For LDPE, the dielectric constant increased from 2.34 to 7.16 as the percentage of carbon was increased from 0% to 20%. For MPE, the dielectric constant increased from 2.27 to 7.26 as the percentage of carbon was increased from 0% to 20%. This showed that bamboo which is known for its high tensile strength when carbonated with polymers enhanced electrical properties of the polymers. Our result showed that bamboo carbon will also protect the polymer from ultra-violet degradation, being that polyethylene is particularly sensitive to ultra-violet radiation. This showed that bamboo charcoal is good for carbonation of polymer.
