Corrosion Behavior of Austenitic Stainless Steel in Sulphuric Acid at Various Concentrations
The susceptibility and resistance of type 304 austenitic stainless steel exposed to sulphuric acids (0.3M to 1M concentrations) at ambient temperatures and at higher temperatures were investigated. Weight loss method was used to examine the corrosion rate of the steel after immersion in the corrosive media. The Constant Extension Rate Tensile Test (CERT) was also performed with a tensometer to determine the susceptibility of the steel to stress corrosion cracking in the corrosive media. This paper reports the observed susceptibility of type 304 austenitic stainless steel to stress corrosion cracking in the corrosive media and its high resistance to uniform corrosion of below 0.1mm/yr.
