Immobilization of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from newly isolated, mutated Bacillus sp. TPR71HNA6 by Entrapment technique
The present investigation was carried out to find the suitable matrix for immobilization of Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) producing strain of newly isolated and mutated Bacillus sp. TPR71HNA6. In this study entrapment technique was employed and alginate, k-carrageenan, agar agar and gelatin were used as supporting matrices. The results indicated that the cells immobilized in calcium alginate were more efficient for CGTase production than the free cells (both conventional and washed). Hence, the alginate matrix was selected as a good matrix for better production of CGTase .
