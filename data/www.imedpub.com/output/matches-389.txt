Effect of sediment and water quality parameters on the productivity of coastal shrimp farm
The present study deals with the sediment and water characteristic of selected shrimp farms. The study envisaged to assess the sediment and water quality, productivity and fertility of the culture ponds and to understand the fluctuations in the values of sediment and water related parameters during the shrimp farming. Results have showed significant monthly variations at all four stations. Positive correlation was found between water temperature and salinity, salinity and primary productivity, primary productivity and dissolve oxygen, dissolve oxygen and nitrate, nitrate and total available phosphorous, soil salinity and soil organic carbon. However a negative correlation was observed between soil organic carbon and pH. Overall mean values of the nutrients in the sediment and water indicated that ponds are fertile and productive for shrimp culture operations.
