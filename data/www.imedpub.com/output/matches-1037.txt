Flood risk management in Ghana: A case study in Accra
Several natural disasters have occurred from the days of biblical Noah until now. These natural disasters have taken various forms like; floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruption tsunamis, tornadoes, landslides, hurricane, and among others. Within the past decades, flooding has become a global pandemic which hampers economic and social development. This global phenomenon has affected 4 million people, loss of lives and economic damages of approximately US$ 780,500,000 in Ghana. It is therefore necessary to ascertain the causes of flood in Ghana and propose an approach that can be helpful to mitigate the flood impacts and save lives and properties. A case study in Accra, the capital of Ghana, will be employed in this paper since it has recorded the highest flood frequency, and how best it can be managed using the Integrated Flood Risk Management approach for the 21st Century
