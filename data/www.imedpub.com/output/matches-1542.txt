Antioxidant properties and total phenolic content of a marine diatom, Navicula clavata and green microalgae, Chlorella marina and Dunaliella salina
The study focuses on determining the antioxidant properties of the different solvent extracts, namely methanol, acetone and hexane, from the microalgae. The evaluation of total phenolic content and antioxidant properties was determined by total antioxidant activity, Ferric reducing antioxidant power, DPPH radical scavenging activity, Hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activity and Nitric oxide radical scavenging assay. Among the tested microalgae, the maximum antioxidant activity was recorded in methanolic extract of C. marina. Whereas methanolic extract of green microalgae and diatom showed good antioxidant potential. This study suggests that different solvent extracts contain different potential antioxidant compounds capable to scavenge different types of free radicals
