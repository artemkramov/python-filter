Comparative Study for Optimization of Nutritional Parameters for Enhanced Production of Glucose Oxidase from Wild and Mutants Strains of A. niger
<strong>Aim:</strong>There is a need for bulk production of glucose because of its vital application in various industries.<strong>Material and methods:</strong>In the present study for the enhanced production of glucose oxidase from wild and mutant derived strains of Aspergillus niger, chemical nutrients were optimized in liquid state shake flask fermentation. Effect of large number of nutritional parameters such as substrates concentration, carbon sources, organic and inorganic nitrogen sources, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O and MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O were optimized. Glucose oxidase activity was assayed for all the parameters.<br><strong>Results:</strong>The optimum glucose oxidase activity from the cultivation of wild and mutant derived strains of Aspergillus niger was achieved at CSL (3%), glucose (3%), urea (0.4%), diammonium sulphate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4</sub>) (0.4%), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) (0.7%), calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) (0.08%), zinc sulphate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O) (0%) and magnesium sulphate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O) (0%) using single factor analysis method.<br><strong>Impact of study:</strong>From the present study it was observed that mutant derived strains have the same nutritional requirement as their parent wild strain Aspergillus niger and there is no significant divergence was found in their production trend. In the present investigation, it was also found that calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) induced the production of glucose oxidase while zinc sulphate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O) and magnesium sulphate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O) were showed their inhibitory behavior. It was also found that single factor analysis is more suitable for studying the effect of large number of variables/factors rather than other statistical methods
