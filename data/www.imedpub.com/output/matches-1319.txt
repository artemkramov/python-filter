Effect of Tridax procumbens extract on calcium oxalate crystallization under in vitro conditions
Kidney stones are from dietary minerals in the urine and there is no suitable drug to use in clinical therapy. Traditionally it is known that Tridax procumbens leaf juice possess antilithiatic property. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal nucleation was significantly inhibited by the presence of Tridax procumbens extract, when compared to control. The effect of leaf extract on crystal growth assay performed showed a concentration dependent trend. The result of crystal aggregation assay reiterates the fact that the plant extract could readily inhibit crystal formation, which clearly indicates the antilithiatic activity of the plant Tridax procumbens
