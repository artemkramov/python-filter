Synthesis, growth and studies of undoped and magnesium chloride doped Lhistidine hydrochloride single crystals
Undoped and magnesium chloride doped L–Histidine Hydrochloride single crystals were synthesized and grown by solution method with slow evaporation technique. Solubility of the samples was measured at different temperatures. The grown crystals were subjected by X–ray diffraction techniques to identify the crystal structure. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT–IR) spectra to identify the functional groups. The UV–Vis–NIR spectral studies were carried out to find the transmittance and other optical parameters. The presence of elements in the grown crystals was identified by EDAX studies. The Vicker’s microhardress test was carried out to test the mechanical stability and the hardness parameters are determined. The TG/DTA and DSC studies confirm the thermal stability of the grown crystals. The second Harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency of the crystals was found by Kurtz and Perry technique
