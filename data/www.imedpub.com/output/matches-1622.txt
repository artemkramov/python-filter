Larval development and embryonic study on Colisa fasciatus : A potential indigenous ornamental fish of North-East India
Colisa fasciatus is a very important indigenous ornamental group of anabantids available in the water bodies of North-East India. In the present trial, partial water exchange and bath treatment of salt solution for 1 minute induced breeding of C. fasciatus. Different larval developmental stages of C. fasciatus from day 1 to day 30 have been recorded. 18-20 days old larvae showed frequent surfacing, first sign of aerial breathing. These anabantids have good potential in domestic and international market due to their beautiful coloration. Thus, to conserve them, mass production techniques should be disseminated among the ornamental fish breeders and which will generate employment opportunities to the unemployed rural youths and thereby earning a substantial amount of foreign exchange to ensure their livelihood.
