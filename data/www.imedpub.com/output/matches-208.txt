A Model for Hepatitis C with Saturated Chronic infection rate Gajendra Ujjainkar1 , V. K. Gupta2, B. Singh1, R. Khandelwal1 and Neetu Trivedi3
Dynamics of an SEI model with acute and chronic stages were studied with mass action incidence by Yuan and Yang [11]. They formulated and analyzed it especially for the case of Hepatitis C virus. A reinvestigation of this model is presented in this paper to study the stability with a general nonlinear incidence rate in chronic stage. Basic Reproduction number R0 has been obtained. When R0 &lt; 1, the disease free equilibrium point is globally stable. In case R0 &gt; 1, there exist endemic equilibrium, for which stability is also discussed.
