The role of the library in the promotion of knowledge societies in Nigeria
From time immemorial, both terms ‘knowledge and information’, which are central to the topic of our seminar today have remained the ‘stock in trade’ or better still, the ‘articles of trade’ in libraries and librarianship. From its earliest, humble beginning, libraries have, till today, been closely associated with and thus closely related to both concepts. Hence, knowledge and information have remained the familiar ‘focus of interest’ of libraries and librarianship thus giving rise to the term knowledge society which has become a household term these days. Yet in too many cases, the understanding of it remains erroneous or shallow. At the same time, deep transformative currents related to knowledge and its production and dissemination in society promise to change the world as we know it, perhaps in the historically short time of a few generations. We are witnessing the beginnings of this transformation and our understanding of the pattern of changes in the library services with very serious positive long-term consequences. That is why a profound understanding of knowledge societies, as they are emerging the world over, is of such great importance.
