Exploring pectinolytic activity of Hormodendrum cladosporioides, a less studied fungus
This study was designed to isolate and purify the pectinase from Hormodendrum cladosporioides, a less studied fungal isolate from the southern Western Ghats through conventional methods. This work also focuses on factors relevant for the improvement of enzymatic hydrolysis of leaf litters using that fungal strain. Different cultural conditions were examined such as pH, temperature and incubation period to assess their effect in optimizing enzyme production. The highest pectinase production was 0.394 IU/ml in the minimal medium fortified with Mangifera indica leaf litters as the carbon source. Optimum pH was found to be 5, temperature 30°C and the 6th day was found to be the best incubation period. All the productions were done in submerged condition and incubated in a shaker at 120 rpm. After finding the suitable physicochemical parameters different nutritional supplements were incorporated to the minimal medium in different concentration for a possible enhancement of the yield. Among five of them used, peptone with 1.25 % concentration showed 0.679 IU/ml pectinase activity followed by casein which showed 0.664 IU/ml and yeast extract with 0.663 IU/ml in the same concentration. We concluded that the minimal medium fortified with M. indica leaf litter wastes with a substrate probably a nitrogen source in optimum conditions are helpful for the fungus to yield maximum enzyme production.
