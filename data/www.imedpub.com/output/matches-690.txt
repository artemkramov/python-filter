Diversity and its Indices of Macroinvertebrates from Dynaneshwar Water Rahuri, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India
In the present study tried to assess indices macroinvertebrates species as Shannon-Weaver index, Shannon index, Species richness, Simpson’s index, Index of Dominance, Index of Evenness of Dynaneshwar water and predict the state of water according to species and physicochemical parameters. The indices were evaluated at individual species level and varied species to species. In the study 17 species from three phylla and five classes were observed. The density of Mollusca, Arthropoda and Annelida were 46.9%, 38.3% and 14.8% respectively. The class wise densities were as Polycheta [14.8%], Malacostraca [15.1%], Bivalve [20.4%], Insecta [23.2%] and Gastropoda [26.5%]
