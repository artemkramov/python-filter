Studies of the physicochemical parameters of soil samples
In the present investigation the physicochemical study of soil is based on various parameters like total Organic Carbon, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P2O5), Potassium (K2O), pH and Conductivity. This study leads us to the conclusion of the nutrient’s quantity present in soil of Bhusawal, District Jalgaon (Maharashtra). Results show that all the eight selected places of Bhusawal have medium or high minerals content. In order to study the effect of phosphate fertilizer, phosphorus, and application of nitrogen to increase percentage yield of crops. This information will help farmers to solve the problems related to soil nutrients, amount of which fertilizers to be used to increase the yield of crops.
