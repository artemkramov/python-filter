An investigation of the soil mycoflora in sugarcane field of Dharmapuri District, Tamilnadu
Soil is a complex ecosystem, delimited by physicochemical parameters that hold enormous number of living organisms. This study deals with the monthly variations in soil fungal population of traditional sugarcane field in Dharmapuri District, Tamilnadu viz Dharmapuri and Pennagaram. About 76 different species belonging to Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes and deuteromycetes were isolated by using PDA medium and identified by using standard manual. The dominant species were Aspergillus chevalieri, A.niger, A.flavus followed by Ceratocystis paradoxa, Bipolaris oryzae, Botrytis cinera, Trichoderma glaucum, Penicillium citrinum and P.chrysogenum from the sugarcane field soils of Dharmapuri in various months whereas, in Pennagaram soils was dominant species were A.niger, Ceratocystis paradoxa followed by A.flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Gliocladium virens, Penicillium citrinum T.viride and Torula allii respectively. Total fungal organisms in two station were 43 species belong to 17 genera were screened from Dharmapuri station and 40 species belong to 15 genera were from Pennagaram station.
