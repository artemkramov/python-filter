Establishing genetic diversity among indigenous cultivated and wild rice species of Manipur using isozyme analysis
Isozyme studies provide preliminary indications that genetic variation may be differently apportioned in some crops compared to their wild relatives. The present investigation was undertaken to study the Isozyme banding patterns and its inheritance in rice with an aim to establish the genetic diversity among the 9 cultivated and wild rice species of Manipur. The indigenous rice collections were subjected to analysis of Isozyme polymorphism at three loci by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Zymograms of all the tested enzyme system (esterase, alcohol dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase) were then constructed, genetic relationships between the nine varieties on the number of loci at which Isozyme pattern differs were determined. In all the enzyme systems studied, only one zone of isozymatic activity defined by the degree of mobility could be observed. Maximum number of bands was observed in Taothabi and Wainuchara (O. rufipogon) local collection I in comparison to other germplasms, the number of bands varied from 1-2. The relationship between these germplasms had been assessed from electrophoresis data and it was observed that Taothabi and Wainuchara i.e., O. rufipogon local collection I showed close relationship in comparison to other germplasms. There is possibility to identify rice species or cultivars available in Manipur using Isozyme analysis and obtain first hand information regarding variability of rice germplasms and also to trace the phylogenetic relationship between the indigenous rice varieties and their wild progenitors
