Length-weight relationship and growth of the green Ã¢ÂÂrough-back pufferfish Lagocephalus lunaris (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), off Visakhapatnam, east coast of India
The length – weight relationship for males and females of Lagocephalus lunaris (Bloch and Schneider, 1801) collected at Visakhapatnam were W = 0.000115 L2.6210 and W = 0.00047 L2.8993 respectively. A single length-weight relationship is given for both the sexes as W = 0.000066 L2.7381. Analysis of covariance conducted to test the difference between the regression slopes of males and females of L. lunaris showed no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The age and growth were estimated by applying ELEFAN 1 method, it confirmed the longevity of the fish to be 61 months. The growth rate was high during the first year and then it declines during subsequent years. The Von Bertalanffy’s growth parameters were Lα = 239.60, K = 2.2, to = -0.146 and Ø = 5.1012/yr.
