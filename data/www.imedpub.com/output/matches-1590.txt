Effects of mixed fermentation on their volatile features of Sichuan Xiaoqu liquor by HS-SPME/GC-MS
To clarify the impact of functional microorganisms on Sichuan xiaoqu liquor’s flavor, during Xiaoqu preparation several pure functional microorganisms (a: alcohol active dry yeast (AADY) + Rhizoups oryzae; b: AADY + Rhizoups oryzae + Monascus; c: AADY + Rhizoups oryzae + Monascus + Mucor; d: AADY + Rhizoups oryzae + Monascus + Mucor + ester producing yeast, related to liquor a, b, c, d.) were used and the volatile components of the liquors evaluated by head space solid phase micro-extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). In total 39, 31, 33, 36 compounds were detected in the liquor a, b, c, d respectively. Results revealed that the three microbes (Monascus, Mucor, ester producing yeast) have little impact on the liquor’s total volatile compounds. Specific compounds, however, did have some distinction: On the basis of adding Rhizoups oryzae with AADY, Mucor could be positive for alcohol but negative for ester, Mucor and Monascus mixed were determined to be positive for the content of naphthalene and phenol, while Mucor, Monascus and ester producing yeast mixed together were positive for ester but negative for aldehyde, ketone and hydrocarbon level.
