Low temperature solution combustion synthesis and luminescence properties of nanoparticle of Sr2SiO4:Dy3+ phosphors
In this paper Dy3+ activated Sr2SiO4 nanophosphors were prepared by low temperature solution combustion method using urea [CO (NH2)2] as a fuel. The obtained phosphor was well characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and UV–visible spectroscopy. The average crystallite sizes were estimated by Debye– Scherer formula. Photoluminescence spectra consist of strong transition at 482nm (blue), 580nm (yellow) and weak transition at 674nm (red). Thermoluminescence study was carried out for the phosphor with UV irradiation show one glow peak .The trapping parameters associated with the prominent glow peak of Sr2SiO4:Dy3+ are calculated by using Chen’s glow curve method.
