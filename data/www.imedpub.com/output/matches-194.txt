Synthesis of Titanium dioxide Nanoparticles and Application on Nylon fabric using Layer by Layer technique for Antimicrobial Property
Nanotechnology is all about making products from very small constituents, components or subsystems to gain greatly enhanced material properties and functionality. In this work, Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were produced using two different reacting mediums by Sol-gel method which were subsequently applied by layer by layer (LBL) technique on Nylon 6,6 fabric for imparting antimicrobial activity. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed after washing treatment to check its durability. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the nanoparticles, their shape and size.
