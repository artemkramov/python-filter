Theoretical ultrasonic velocity studies of pentanol containing methyl benzoate and benzene at 301K
Theoretical ultrasonic velocity for the binary mixtures of pentanol with benzene and ternary mixtures of pentanol with methyl benzoate in benzene systems have been predicted at 301K using various theoretical relations . The experimental values are compared with the theoretical values of ultrasonic velocity of Nomotos relation, Van Dael relations, Impedance relations, Junjies relation, Impedance relations, Rao relations. The deviation of theoretical values of velocity from the experimental values shows that the molecular interaction is taking place between the unlike molecules in the liquid mixture. The deviation in the variation of U2 Exp / U2 mix from unity has also been evaluated for explaining the non-ideality in the mixtures. It is observed that the Nomoto’s relation give the better results followed the other theoretical models for these systems.
