Double-diffusive rotatory convection coupled with cross-diffusions in viscoelastic fluid
The present paper investigates the effect of a uniform vertical rotation on the physical problem of double-diffusive convection coupled with cross-diffusions in viscoelastic fluid. Some general qualitative results concerning the stability of oscillatory motions and limitations on the oscillatory motions of growing amplitude are derived. The results for the double- diffusive convection problems with or without the individual consideration of Dufour and Soret effects follow as a consequence
