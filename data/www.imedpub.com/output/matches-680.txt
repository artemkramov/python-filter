Determination of the density distribution of holes injected into an NType material
The density distribution of holes injected into an n-type material was studied using continuity equation which was applied to diffusion equation with some boundary conditions such as; Nh (x=0), for an injected hole density and Nh (x →∞), for equilibrium of hole density in the n-type material. The meaning of semiconductor and its basic characteristic properties were))For equilibrium hole density in the n-type material. The meaning of semiconductor and its basic concepts and characteristics properties were extensively and exclusively discussed. The meaning ofbasic concept and chwere extensively and exclusively discussed. The meaning of hole and its basic concepts were also explained. Our ability to develop the mathematical concept to calculate the density of holes injected into an n-type material will help in providing the best way to understanding the basic operations existing semi-conductor devices which is the backbone of electronic industries.
