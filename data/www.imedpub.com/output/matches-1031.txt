A report on the extended distribution of a rare Indian freshwater mussel species (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Unionidae)
Freshwater mussels are well known as ‘Ecosytem Engineers’ for the ecosystem services they provide. Therefore knowledge of their distribution and conservation will help in sustaining natural ecosystems. This study reports on the extended distribution of a rare Indian freshwater bivalve, Lamellidens daccaensis (Preston, 1912) from River Krishna, Nagarjuna Sagar, Telangana, India. This note is a first record of the species from South India. The re-description and taxonomic history of Lamellidens daccaensis and related species are provided in this article
