Studies on Optical, Dielectric and Electrical Conductivity Properties of Zinc Succinate NLO Single Crystal
Single crystals of Zinc Succinate (ZS) have been successfully grown from aqueous solution by slow evaporation method. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the crystal belongs to monoclinic system with the space group C2. The optical transmission study reveals the transparency of the crystal in the entire visible region and the cut off wavelength has been found to be 320 nm. The optical band gap is found to be 3.60 eV. Dielectric constant and dielectric loss measurements were carried out at different temperatures and frequencies. AC electrical conductivity and photoconductivity studies are also carried out and the results are discussed.
