Bioactive Compounds Identification of Pleurotus platypus and Pleurotus eous by GC-MS
In this study, Pleurotus platypus and Pleurotus eous was subjected to identification of bioactive compounds by using Gas chromatography – Mass spectrum technique. These two organisms were extracted with 99% of ethanol. Extracted sample was injected, according to the retention time and peak formation the bioactive compounds are screened. In Pleurotus platypus Pyridine- 3-carboxamide, 4-dimethylamino-N-(2, 4-difluorophenyl), Piperidin-4-carboxylic acid, Aspidofractinine-3-methanol, (2à, 3á, 5à), Indolizine, and 2-(4-methylphenyl)-. Pleurotus eous shows that Imidazolidine, 1, 3-dinitro, Phenol, 2-methyl-4-(1, 1, 3, 3-tetramethylbutyl), Aspidofractinine-3-methanol, (2à, 3á, 5à) and Squalene.
