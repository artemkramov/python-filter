The importance of mathematics transcends all definitions and descriptions. Technological Advancement of any country depends on the volume and quality of mathematics offered in its school system. Without mathematics the understanding of national problems would be superficial. However, only a handful of people, even among those who have chosen mathematics as a life career are aware of the importance of mathematics to mankind and the entire universe. In this paper, the universal importance and application of mathematics to man and his immediate environment is highlighted. It is hoped that the submissions would kindle in people an ardent interest in mathematics, so much so that more and more people would begin to choose mathematics as a discipline to study. If it does, the purpose of the paper would have been achieved.
