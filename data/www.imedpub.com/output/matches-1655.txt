On the study of magneto-hydrodynamics boundary layer flow over a continuously moving flat plate
The objective of the present study is to investigate the steady, two dimensional laminar boundary layer flow of an incompressible, electrically conducting fluid over a continuously flat plate in the presence of transverse magnetic field. The governing equations of continuity and momentum are transformed into ordinary differential equations using similarity transformation. The present flow situation is derived by the one parameter group of transformation
