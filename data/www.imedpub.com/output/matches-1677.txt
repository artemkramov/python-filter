Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of human pathogenic bacteria related to Enterobacteriaceae family causing urinary tract infection
Gram negative bacteria are most commonly involved in causing Urinary tract infection (UTI), a urinary disease most commonly found in developing countries. The regular monitoring of specific areas gains the knowledge about the prevalence of these in the UTI and their susceptibility pattern is useful for the clinicians to choose correct empirical treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the type of Gram negative bacteria related to Enterobacteriaceae involved in UTI and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the urinary pathogens. Total 132 urine samples were collected by mid stream clean catch method and tested bacteriologically using standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Total 48.48% urine samples showed significant bacterial growth. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (42.71%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.96%), Proteus spp (19.79%) and Enterobacter spp (13.54%). 90.24% E. coli showed resistance to Nalidixic acid, however, Amikacin showed 100% sensitivity to isolated E. coli. Ciprofloxacin and imipenem showed 69.57% resistance in K. pneumonia, however, Levofloxacin showed 100% sensitivity. Nitrofurantoin showed 92.30% resistance in Enterobacter spp and most quinolones and carbenicillins was susceptible to Enterobacter spp. Proteus spp was 100% resistant against Third generation cephalosporin, however, Carbepenems was highly susceptible to isolated Proteus spp. Meropenem (90.63%) was most sensitive among all isolated UTI pathogens and Nalidixic acid showed 67.71% sensitivity among all isolates
