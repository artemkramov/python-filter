Material applications of novel heterocyclic disperse and mordent dyes based on 2-butyl-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzofuran
The novel mordent and disperse heterocyclic dyes were prepared by coupling of various diazo solution of aromatic amines with 2-Butyl-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzofuran. The resultant mordent and disperse heterocyclic dyes were characterized by elemental analyses, IR and NMR spectral studies. The UV-visible spectral data have also been discussed in terms of structural property relationship. The dyeing assessment of all the mordent and disperse heterocyclic dyes was evaluated on wool and polyester textile fibers. The results of antibacterial studies of chrome pretreated fabrics revealed that the toxicity of mordented dyes against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis bacteria was fairly good.
