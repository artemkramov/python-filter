A novel process for physically refining rice bran oil through degumming
A new process for the physical refining of rice bran oil through combined degumming was developed on a laboratory scale. Studies were conducted to improve quality of rice bran oil by degumming to make it edible grade. Oil contains phosphatides, carbohydrates mucilages, proteins and resins as a gummy substance which impact colour turbidity and odour to rice bran oil. This investigation showen that phosphoric acid and water mixture (0.75 + 3 %) appear to be most effective degumming agent. The transmittance of oil improved from 37 to 57 % at 570 nm. The Viscosity, Unsaponification matter and melting point decrease and Iodine Value and Saponification value increased in degummed rice bran oil as compare to rice bran oil. The results of present investigation are shown to improve the quality of oil.
