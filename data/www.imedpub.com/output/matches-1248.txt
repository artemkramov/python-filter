Structural, optical and electrical properties of doped copper ZnS thin films prepared by chemical spray pyrolysis technique
In this study, ZnSand Cu incorporated at (2%, 4%,6%, 8%, and 10%) thin films were growth onto hot glass substrates at substrates temperature 2750C with thickness about 100+10 nm by chemical spray pyrolysis technique The spray solutions contains Zn(CH3COO)2.2H2O, SC(NH2)2 and CuCl2.2H2O with molar concentration 0.1M/L. The Structure of the prepared films were studied from XRD pattern, the results shows that the films were polycrystalline with cubic phase for pure ZnS and hexagonal phase for Zn1-xS:Cuxat x=10%.The optical properties of the films were studied using UV–VIS spectrophotometer in the range (350-1100) nm. The optical constants were studied as a function of the wavelength and increased with increasing Cu content for Zn1-xS:Cux. The optical band gaps for the direct transition were estimate too and it was 3.44eVfor pure ZnS and increased with increasing Cu concentration from 3.50 to 3.69eV. Measurements of D.C conductivity with different temperature (298-473)K showed that D.C conductivity decreases while the thermal activation energy (Ea) increased with increasing Cu concentration
