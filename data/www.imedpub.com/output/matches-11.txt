Investigation on physico-chemical properties of semiorganic nonlinear optical L-lysine sulphate single crystal
Single Crystals of L-lysine sulphate (abbreviated as LLS), a semiorganic nonlinear (NLO) materials have been successfully grown by slow solvent evaporation solution growth technique at room temperature. Solubility curve of LLS has been determined in mixed solvent of acetone and water. The grown crystal is characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. The UV–Vis transmittance spectrum shows that the material has low optical absorption in the entire visible region. The relative second harmonic generation is confirmed by Kurtz powder technique. Electrical conductivity measurements are carried out on LLS crystals at various temperatures. Photoconductivity studies of LLS reveals that it exhibits negative photoconductivity.
