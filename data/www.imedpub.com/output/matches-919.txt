Mathematical modelling on water pollution and self-purification of river Ganges
The Pollution of India’s National River Ganges has become grim task for today. After observing the data it has been found that Ganges in high profile cities like Kanpur, Varanasi and Allahabad are highly polluted. In this study pollution is analysed in these highly polluted areas and a dynamical model is formulated to solve the pollution problem. In the paper it is shown mathematically that if sewage treatment capacity is increased then how pollution in the river goes on decreasing. Self-purification of Ganges is taken into account using de-oxygenation and reaeration process. After analysing self-purification concept certain results are concluded about the pollution of river. It is advisable that sewage treatment network should be increased on a large scale in highly polluted stretches like KANPUR-VARANASI. The target goal of this paper is to draw attention towards dying condition of Ganges in these regions and through mathematical model an idea is given that how poorest condition of Ganges in these areas can be recovered
