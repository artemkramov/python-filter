Bioaccumulation of alkali and alkaline earth metals (sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium) in fish (Labeo rohita Ham.) organs from selected districts of Odisha, India
The bioaccumulation of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium were estimated in five different organs i.e., tissue, kidney, gills, liver, and testis/ovary of rohu, Labeo rohita (Ham.). The samples were collected from three study areas namely Kendrapada (KPD), Keonjhar (KEO) and Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) in Odisha. There was recorded a large variation in accumulation of metals in different tissues. The content of metals in gonads was estimated lower compared to other tissues. The pooled data for all the stations revealed that, in different organs the content of sodium (102±2.190 to 64±1.303), potassium (3.6±0.031 to 2.31±0.572), calcium (17.42±0.618 to 9.88±1.406) and magnesium (20±1.095 to 10±1) ppm respectively in wet wt. But in water medium the contents of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium were 7.6±0.712 to 7.2±2.002, 14.3±1.463 to 12.8±2.037, 21.92±0.494 to 17.06±3.495 and 20±1.233 to 18.3±2.202 ppm respectively. The content of calcium, magnesium and potassium in different organs were low in comparison to the water medium. But the content of sodium in different organs was higher in comparison to that of water medium. The content of calcium, magnesium and sodium were recorded higher in body tissue than other organs, but the content of potassium was nearly equal in all tissues
