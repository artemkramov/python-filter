Effect on physical properties of Ge20Se80-xGax glass system with compositional variations
The effect on the physical properties viz. average coordination number, number of constraints, cross-linking density, molecular weight, fraction of floppy modes, Lone-pair electron, mean bond energy, glass transition temperature etc., with the variation in Gallium content has been studied theoretically in the present article for Ge20Se80-xGax (x=2 to 16 at. %) glassy alloys. Tichy-Ticha approach has been used to study the glass transition temperature and mean bond energy. It has been found that almost all the parameters, studied here, except molecular weight, fraction of floppy modes, Lone-pair electron and the parameter R were increased with the increase in Ga content.
