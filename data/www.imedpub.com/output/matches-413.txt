A Note on Gravitational Radiation with Geometric Constraints
Beginning with the Einstein Field equations, we characterize gravitational waves by expressing the one dimensional wave equation in terms of Lie derivatives for the space-time general relativity. A condition for a radiative gravitational field is obtained. This condition proves to be satisfied for the exact solution, including plane waves as well as approximate solutions.
