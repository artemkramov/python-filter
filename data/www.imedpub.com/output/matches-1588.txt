Behavior of dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent in Cd2+ and Cr3+ substituted magnesium ferrites
Spinel ferrites with general formula CdxMg1-xFe2-yCryO4 (x=0,0.2,0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.00; y=0, 0.05 and 0.10) were prepared by standard ceramic method. Dielectric constant (ÃÂ­) and dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) were determined in the frequency range 20Hz to 1MHz at room temperature. To study the behavior, ÃÂ­ and tan δ were plotted against frequency. These plots show dispersion at lower frequencies. Such behavior is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization. It is also found that Dielectric constant increases with cadmium content while it decreases with chromium content. This is explained on the basis of conduction mechanism, wherein addition of cadmium content increases conduction and decreases with chromium content
