Radiation effects on MHD free convective boundary layer flow of nanofluids over a nonlinear stretching sheet
The present study focuses on the numerical solution of a steady free convective boundary-layer flow of a radiating nanofluid along a non-linear stretching sheet in the presence of transverse magnetic field. The model used for the nanofluid incorporates the effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis. The governing boundary-layer equations of the problem are formulated and transformed into a non-similar form. The resultant equations are then solved numerically using Runge-Kutta fourth order method along with shooting technique. In the absence of radiation parameter, magnetic parameter and for m = 1 (the non-linear stretching parameter), our results showed a good agreement with those of Anwar et al.[36] and also with that of Khan and Pop [34], for further reduced case. The physics of the problem is well explored for the embedded material parameters through graphs and tables. Further there is a scope of researching the reactions taking place in the mixture and the heat source /sink
