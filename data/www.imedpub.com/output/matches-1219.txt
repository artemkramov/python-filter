Oligosaccharides structure by chemical hydrolysis from seeds polysaccharide of Withania somnifera Dunal (Ashwagandha) plant
Chemical partial hydrolysis of water soluble Withania somnifera Dunal seeds polysaccharide gave a mixture of two disaccharides and one trisaccharide as : (I) 6-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-O-α-D-mannopyranose; (II) 4-O-β-Dglucopyranosyl-( 1→4)-O-β-D-mannopyranose and (III) 4-O-β-D-mannopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-mannopyranosyl- (1→4)-O-β-mannopyranose.
