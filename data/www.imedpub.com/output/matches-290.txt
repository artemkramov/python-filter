Transient convective heat and mass transfer flow in an axially varying pipe with traveling thermal wave
The effect of thermal radiation and thermo-diffusion on the unsteady combined heat and mass transfer of a viscous incompressible fluid in a corrugated pipe in the presence of a constant heat source. The unsteadiness is due to a traveling thermal wave imposed on the boundary. Taking the slope of the boundary wall of the pipe as a perturbation parameter, the equations governing the flow, heat and mass transfer have been solved. The velocity, the temperature and the concentration have been evaluated for different variations. The effect of the waviness of the boundary on the flow phenomenon has been exhibited through various profiles of the velocity, the temperature and the concentration. The shear stress, the rate of heat and mass transfer are analyzed computationally for different parameters.
