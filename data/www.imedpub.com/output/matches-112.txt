Antimicrobial Properties and Phytochemical Screening of Some Wild Macrofungi of Rani - Garbhanga Reserve Forest Area of Assam, India
Natural products have potential of containing agents for various diseases. The increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria has revived the interest in alternative antimicrobial substances from natural resources to control the pathogenic micro-organisms. The antimicrobial activity of few macrofungal species isolated from Rani-Garbhanga Reserve forest areas of Assam were used for screening of antimicrobial potential. Auricularia auricula-judae, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus tuber-regium, Pycnoporous sanguineus, Schizophyllum commune, Trametes elegans, Trametes versicolor and Tremella fuciformis are investigated against a panel of standard bacteria. The tested microorganisms includes Bacillus subtillis MTCC 736, Salmonella typhi MTCC 3216, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 3160, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 7837 and Eschercia coli MTCC 40. Among the macrofungal species studied the ethanolic extracts of four macrofungi showed satisfactory results. Macrofungal extracts analyzed (water and ethanol) showed wider inhibition zones in disc-diffusion method for Trametes elegans and found to be most effective followed by Pleurotus tuber-regium, Auricularia auricular-judae. The phytochemical screening of the macro fungal extracts revealed the presence of secondary metabolites like glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, triterpenoids and saponins, etc. The present study reveals the biopharmaceutical potential of few indigenous macrofungal species of Rani-Garbhanga Reserve forest areas of Assam.
