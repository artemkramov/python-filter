Crystal growth and characterization of a new NLO material: 4-Methoxyaniline
Single crystals of 4- Methoxyaniline (4MAL), an organic nonlinear optical (NLO) material, have been grown slow evaporation method at room temperature from the ethanol – Water solution. The crystal system has been confirmed from the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The functional groups were identified using FTIR spectroscopy. UV–Vis–NIR spectrum showed the absence of absorption in the wavelength region of 340–800 nm and UV cut-off wavelength of 4MAL occurs at 340 nm. The SHG efficiency of 4MAL was measured by employing Kurtz and Perry powder technique using a Q-switched mode locked Nd: YAG laser emitting 1064 nm for the first time. Intensity of the bright emission was found to be 1.66 times of standard KDP. Its thermal, mechanical properties were examined by TG/DTA, Vickers microhardness tester respectively
