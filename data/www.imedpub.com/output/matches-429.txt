Identification of inorganic elements in egg shell of some wild birds in Baghdad
The object of this study was to identification of inorganic elements in egg shell of some wild birds included House Sparrow, White- eared Bulbul, Collared Dove and Rock Dove. Samples of eggs from these birds were collected from Baghdad city during 2011. Egg shell were analysis for ash, macro-elements and micro- elements included Ca, P, Mg, Fe, K, Mn, B, Zn, Co, Cr and Pb. Results obtained revealed that ash percentage were high in egg shell of all studied birds which were 1.73, 1.72, 1.79 and 1.78 % for House Sparrow, White- eared Bulbul, Collared Dove and Rock Dove respectively, Ca percentage was the highest percentage among the other elements which were 97.3, 97.4, 97.8 and 97.8 % respectively, whenas P and Mg were between 0.85 and 0.89 %. Shells of House Sparrow eggs were high in Cr, in the same time the shells of White- eared Bulbul eggs were high in K, Collared dove and Rock dove were high in Fe, Mn and B. Percentage of Pb in egg shell of all studied birds were low.
