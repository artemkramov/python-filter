Presence of extended spectrum ÃÂ²-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients
Ten strains of Gram-negative bacteria comprising of 5 Escherichia coli and 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from blood samples of hospitalized patients in Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital (EBSUTH), Abakaliki. Detection of extended spectrum β-lactamases was carried out by double disc diffusion test methods. Identification of organisms was done using appropriate microbiological technique. Antibiotics susceptibility test was carried out Mueller-Hinton agar using the disc diffusion method. Ofloxacin and cefoxitin were 100% active against E. coli, followed by sulphamathroxazole with 80% activity. While ofloxacin was 100% active against K. pneumoniae, followed by cefoxitin and tetracycline with 80% activity. Amikacin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This resistance is associated with extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) production which was detected in K. pneumoniae and E. coli. ESBL production was observed in 80% of Gramnegative bacilli. This present study suggested that clinical microbiology laboratories should take into account the changing epidemiology of ESBL producers in order to establish a proper treatment procedure.
