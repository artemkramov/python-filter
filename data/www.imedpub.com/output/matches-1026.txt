Role of knowledge management in Geoinformatics
Knowledge management technology is used to collaborative integration of multiple forms of spatial knowledge in support of collaborative community planning. The knowledge management system included a customized user interface for data entry. One of the most widely uses of photogrammetry are in preparation of topographic maps. In modern time photogrammetric operations are commonly used to produce a range of GIS data products. The satellite imagery information as satellite images (Landsat, SPOT, JERS, Corona etc) and products(DEM, GCP, land cover map etc) using satellite images and other primitive sources in remote sensing. Remote sensing is a technique to observe the earth surface or the atmosphere from out of space using satellites or from the air using aircrafts. The recent advantage of Geographic Information Systems and Global Positioning Systems has created an effective means by which the acquired data are analyzed for the effective development and mapping of temporal dynamics of glaciers. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss using areas and contribution potentials of knowledge management in geoinformatics
