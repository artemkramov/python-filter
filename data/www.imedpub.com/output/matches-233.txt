Groundwater Contamination from Agro-Chemicals in irrigated Environment: Field Trials
This paper highlights on the increasing fears that chemicals in agriculture have found their way into drinking water causing health complications. In fact many chemicals have not had these effects but waiting to do so by moving into groundwater sinking slowly and finally going into taps. Nitrate fertilizer is largely blamed for these fears. Use of fertilizers obviously would increase manifold to meet the food needs arising out of population explosion and it would further aggravate the situation. Therefore the use of chemicals in agriculture presents global alarm particularly for Andhra Pradesh where environmental degradation is rampant and unfortunately least groundwater contamination resulting from application of agricultural chemicals especially the fertilizer.
