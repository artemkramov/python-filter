Removal and decolorization Adsorption study of dye bearing textile effluents by Sulfinated Urea-Formaldehyde resin
Textile effluent was collected and treated with various mixtures of sulfinated urea-formaldehyde (SUF) resin, rice husk, bagasse and animal charcoal. The resultant liquids were almost colorless with very low COD. The sludge can also be used for other purpose, like pigmentation as well as filler for plastic manufacturing. Such adsorbents may have entity in environmental science. The dye absorption behaviour of this resin were evaluated by varying conditions like dye concentration, contact time and pH, weight and temperature. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were used for data description.
