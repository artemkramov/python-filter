Effects of laser radiation, transverse electric field and roughness of the boundary on Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a thin poorly conducting viscous fluid
This paper deals with the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) at the interface between heavy poorly conducting fluid supported by a lighter poorly conducting fluid in the presence of transverse electric field, thermal radiation and roughness with slip boundary condition at bottom rough wall and no-shear condition at the top interface. Analytical solutions are obtained for modified Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the presence of applied electric field and laser radiation. These solutions are computed for different values of electric number, Bond number, roughness parameter and laser frequency parameter and found that roughness of the wall and electric field reduce the growth rate of RTI considerably
