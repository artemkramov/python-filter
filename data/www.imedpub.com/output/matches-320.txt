Mass transfer effects on mhd flows exponentially accelerated isothermal vertical plate in the presence of chemical reaction through porous media
A finite difference solution of mass transfer effects on MHD flow of incompressible viscous dissipative fluid past an exponentially accelerated isothermal vertical plate, on taking into account of viscous dissipative heat, under the influence of chemical reaction through porous medium is evaluated. The velocity, temperature and concentration are studied for different parameters such as the magnetic field parameter, Grashof number, mass Grashof number, chemical reaction parameter, Schmidt number, Prandtl number, permeability parameter. The numerical values of Skin-friction are in tabulated
