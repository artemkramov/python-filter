Isolation and characterization of heavy metal Resistant Pseudomonas spp. and their plant growth promoting activities
Interactions between plants and microorganisms in the rhizosphere (rhizobacteria) can clearly affect crop yields. Rhizobacteria that benefit plant growth and development are called PGPR. the most studied PGPR belong to gramnegative genera, and the greatest number of strains are members of the fluorescent pseudomonads in our present investigation was to study the plant growth promoting (PGP) activities and heavy metal resistant Pseudomonas spp. from wheat &amp; pigeon pea fields of Allahabad district. From nine different rhizospheric soil of wheat &amp; pigeon pea different Pseudomonas spp. were isolated. Among the 21, four Pseudomonas spp. In four different Pseudomonas spp isolates ( YSY-13, YSY-15,YSY-17 and YSY-19) exhibited maximum plant growth promoting and heavy metal tolerant activities The isolates could exhibit more than two or three PGP traits, which may promote plant growth directly or indirectly or synergistically. Further, rhizobacteria tolerant to multiple heavy metals exhibited a couple of PGP activities.
