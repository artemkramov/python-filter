Effects of lead on Lathyrus sativus seeds
This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Lead on the seed germination and seedling growth of Lathyrus sativus. Seeds were subjected separately to five levels (0, 0.001%, 0.01%,0.1% and 1% w/v) of the metal salt. Results showed that the germination increased significantly with different metal concentrations. However, no germination occurred at 1% concentration’s of lead salt. Shoot length was more affected by metal lead than root length. Our results exhibited that less concentrations of lead had more effect on seed germination and growth parameters of Lathyrus sativus are studied. Finally the investigation of interaction impacts of these element lead on Lathyrus sativus seeds is recommended.
