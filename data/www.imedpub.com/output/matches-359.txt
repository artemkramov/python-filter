Relationship between organizational justice and job burnout in employees of Sport and Youth Head Office of Tehran
The primary objective of this study was to determine the relationship between organizational justice and job burnout in employees of Sport and Youth Head Office of Tehran in Iran. This was a population based study (N= 180). Data were collected using two questionnaires including organizational justice inventory- Todd and Chester (2007) and burnout inventory- Maslach and Hezel (1977). The face and content validity of questionnaires were confirmed with corrective feedback from experts and professors in the sports management field, and Cronbach's alpha reliability test of organizational justice and burnout were 0.94 and 0.72, respectively. Descriptive statistics, Kolmogorov Smirnoff, Pearson correlation coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze data. Results showed a significant negative association between organizational justice and employee burnout (r= -0.19, p= 0.04). In addition, among the subscales of organizational justice, procedural justice was the only subscale that showed the significant negative relationship with burnout (r= -0.28, P= 0.003). Moreover, regression analysis showed that the distributive justice subscale can be considered as a predictor for job burnout. In conclusion, the findings of this study showed if organizational managers show more equity in their performance, it reduces job burnout among employees and consequently improvement in their job effectiveness, efficiency and performance.
