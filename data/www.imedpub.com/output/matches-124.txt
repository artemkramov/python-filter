Effects of heat transfer on MHD oscillatory flow of Jeffrey fluid with variable viscosity through porous medium
In this paper, Influence of heat transfer on MHD oscillatory flow Jeffrey fluid with variable viscosity model through porous medium is investigated. The fluid viscosity is assumed to vary as an exponential function of temperature. The effects of various emerging parameters on the velocity field and temperature field are discussed in detail through graphs.
