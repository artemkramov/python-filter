Kinetic modeling and equilibrium studies of selected endocrine disrupting chemicals on to low cost adsorbent
This research investigates the sorption properties of bisphenol A (BPA), 17β estradiol (E2) and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in an aquatic environment by investigating the effectiveness of using batch and continuous processes. The adsorbents used were activated carbon of 2 mm and 0.4 mm diameter with powdered poly 1-methylperrol-2- ylsquaraine (PMPs).They were applied to remove BPA, E2 and EE2 from aqueous solutions at a fixed concentration of 2 mg/l. The influence rate of agitation and dosage on EDCs removal and adsorption capacity was investigated by conducting a series of batch experiments. The adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 2 h with average percentage removal of 98.2 %( BPA) 96.5 %( E2) and 94.5 %( EE2).The kinetic adsorption process could be described by pseudo-first order model by AC1 and intra-particle kinetics by PMPs. The adsorption constants were evaluated according to Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and D-R isotherm models. The experimental adsorption data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption model but best for Langmuir (R2=0.99).
