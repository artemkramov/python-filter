The impact of industrial effluents from Dakace industrial area on the physicochemical properties of River Galma, Zaria, Nigeria
River Galma basin around Dakace Industrial Layout, Zaria, Nigeria, was studied between May 2011 and May 2012 to determine the Influence of Industrial effluents from the Industrial Area, on the water Quality of the River by comparing the levels of physico-chemical parameters of water quality in the upstream area before the identified effluent discharge points (Point sources) and downstream after the effluent discharge points. Results indicated that Temperature, Electrical Conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Suspended Solids, Alkalinity, pH, Turbidity and Chloride showed the range 21.4-35.2 °C, 32.00-182.00 μS/cm, 25.02-77.09 mg/l, 27.38-78.24 mg/l, 15.81-140.85 mg/l, 4.00-7.68, 32.30-458.00 NTU and 17.02-318 mg/l respectively. All the parameters examined showed significant seasonal variation (P &lt; 0.05), Temperature being the only exception. Most of the parameters analyzed (Temperature, Electrical Conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Suspended Solids and Alkalinity) were found to be within World Health Organization (WHO) and US-EPA permissible limit for drinking water quality. pH, Turbidity and Chloride were however, seriously implicated. It was established from the results that industrial discharges had negative impact on the surface water quality of the river. Hence, extraction of water from the river for domestic and agricultural purposes requires some forms of physical and chemical treatment.
