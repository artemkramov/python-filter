This study estimated the profitability of RTEP small holder root and tuber crop farmers in Plateau State, north central Nigeria. A multi-stage random sampling method was used to select 160 root and tuber crop farmers who were interviewed for the study using close and open ended questionnaire. Information on the inputs used and output realized in the root and tuber production were collected and subjected to various analyses using the net farm income equation. Root and tuber crops in Plateau state was profitable with a net farm income of RTEP and non- RTEP participants was N128,469.60/Ha and N91,462.30/Ha respectively while the return per Naira (N) invested for RTEP and non-RTEP participants was N1.62k and N95k respectively. Suitable increase in farm size was recommended in the study area to further widen the profit margin
