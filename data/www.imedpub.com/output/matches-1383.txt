Recent studies on the biodiversity of snakes in Palghar region, Thane, Maharashtra, India
Snakes are abundant all over the world except in the Artics, New Zealand and Ireland. It is postulated that there are about 3000 species of terrestrial snakes in the world and they are predominant in the warm climates and lushgreen regions of the tropics. About 278 species are found in India out of which 58 species are venomous. The snakes are objects of fascination for studies since time immemorable. The body of snake is often modified to suit its ecological conditions. These are particularly noticed as fossorial, arboreal, aerial, aquatic &amp; terrestrial forms. Many snakes have been spotted in and around their habitats during our visit / studies or during stress calls made by residents to snake charmers/ rescuers/NGO’s etc. in Palghar. Palghar is an upcoming town and a Municipal Council in Thane district in Maharashtra, situated about 87kms from Mumbai. It is a prominent region with pleasant greenery, soothing environment surrounded by trees, shrubs and other vegetation in the hilly terrains, plains and adjacent areas of the nearby shore. Recently this region is rapidly undergoing industrialization, infrastructural development including townships etc. and as such these areas are prone to habitat loss due to which different types of snake including venomous, semi-venomous, non-venomous are being noticed in the residential areas during monsoons and winter seasons. The present studies are an attempt to evaluate the information, occurrence, abundance &amp;species richness and further assist in the knowledge, awareness and conservation of snake fauna in this region since there is acute paucity of established work and data on this subject till date
