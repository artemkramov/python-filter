Reproductive biology of common silver Biddy, Gerres filamentosus (Cuvier)
Common silver biddy Gerresfilamentosus were collected monthly between November 2002 and November 2005 fromFort Kochiof Kerala. The seasonal reproductive cycle of this species was investigated using histological observation of gonads. On the basis of morphological and histological changes, which the ovaries undergo during maturation, five stages of maturity are identified such as immature, maturing and recovering spent, mature, ripe and spent. From the histological study of Oogenesis, a number of distinct developmental stages were delineated in G.filamentosus, viz. the oogonia,Chromatin nucleolus stage, Early and Late Perinucleolusstages,Lipid droplet stage, Cortical alveoli(Yolk vesicle) stage,Yolk granule stage and Mature oocytes
