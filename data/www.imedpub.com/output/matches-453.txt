The impact of roasting and reheating on the microbial load of Ã¢ÂÂIwe EkpangÃ¢ÂÂ (Steamed Cassava Batter)
The evaluation of iwe ekpang [‘steamed cassava batter’] processed from freshly harvested cassava [‘Manihot esculenta’] stored for 24 hours, prepared into fresh, reheated and roasted samples were analysed using Standard Microbiological Techniques[STM] and the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates using Disc Diffusion Technique[DDT]. The bacteria isolated were Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The fungi isolated were mould spp. and Aspergillus sp. The results also revealed that ‘Iwe ekpang’ C1 and EK6 had the highest 7.8 x 105 and 1.10 x 106 cfu/g, respectively and the highest mycological count was also obtained from ‘iwe ekpang’ Ek4 and Ek6, 4.2 x 105 and 4.4 x 105 accordingly. The reheated ‘iwe ekpang’ [Ek1 and Ek5] is safer and is within the limit recommended by International Commission on Microbiological Specification for ready to eat foods. Among the antibiotics used, the organism were susceptible to Ofloxacin followed by Perflacin and Gentomycin.The isolates gave gross resistant to Tetracycline, Ampicillin and Nalidixic acid. The PH range from 5.6 to 7.9. Nevertheless this result reveals most potent drug for treatment of those affected by this organisms in any case of food spoilage or poisoning caused by the tested bacteria.
