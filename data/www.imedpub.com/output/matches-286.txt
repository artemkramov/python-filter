Performance of lightweight thin-walled steel sections: theoretical and mathematical considerations
Globally, thin-walled steel sections have been extensively employed as prime load-bearing members, such as wall studs, floor joints, columns and beams, in low to medium-rise buildings such as offices, hotels, flat blocks and houses. In spite of the accessibility of steel sections, there are still vital barriers that restrain its recognition and execution in the construction industry. Perhaps one of the major barriers is that the building industry is in general disinclined to execute alternative building methods and materials unless it demonstrates obvious and comprehensible quality or performance benefits. It can be found that the behaviour of thin-walled steel sections, including local buckling, distortional buckling, global buckling and shear buckling have been well understood and appropriate design methods existed. The theoretical and mathematical equations presented in this paper will aid future researchers in designing satisfactory thin-walled steel structures holistically.
