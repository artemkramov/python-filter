Removal of Pb &amp; Ni from industrial wastewater by using brass industry waste (Slag) as an adsorbent
The removals of Pb and Ni from their aqueous solution, using Brass industry slag as an adsorbent studied as slag consist of calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide etc. The research is a bench scale experimental type and analysis have performed by using different amount of adsorbent in solution with five different concentration of both metals and also in mixed combination. About 90% and 100% Pb removal achieved by using 0.5 and 1.5 g adsorbent for solution having concentration of 5 and 10 mg/L Pb. It was also found that adsorption efficiency depend on the amount of adsorbent as adsorption efficiency of Ni was increased from 75% to 100% in the same solution(5 mg/L).It was also observed that adsorption efficiency was decreased about 4% and 8% of Pb and Ni in Mixed metal solution.
