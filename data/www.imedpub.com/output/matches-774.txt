Preliminary report of Dehulling effect on the occurrence and distribution of Aspergillus flavus in maize grains stored in Mubi market
The effect of dehulling on the occurrence and distribution of Aspergillus flavus in some stored maize grains in Mubi grains market has been carried out using direct plating technique. All the undehulled samples yielded the presence of Aspergillus flavus, while none was detected in the dehulled samples that were immediately cultured. The dehulled samples that were stored over one month revealed Aspergillus flavus in five samples out of ten, while none was detected in the remaining five samples. The results indicated that dehulling eliminates the fungal (A. flavus) infestation of maize grains and that poor storage condition might have favoured the growth of Aspergillus flavus that were recovered in some stored dehulled maize samples.
