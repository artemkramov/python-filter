Effect of low and high concentration of glycine of properties of KDP crystals
Crystals of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) doped with Glysine has been grown by solvent evaporation technique at 320 C. The crystalline nature of the crystal is verified by powder X-ray diffraction studies. The presence of functional groups has been identified by both Fourier transform infrared spectrum. The optical nature of grown crystal is analyzed using UV- Visible spectrum. The effect of different concentration of dopant on the dielectric constant is studied shows that the dielectric constant goes on decreasing on increasing the frequency.
