Alteration of antioxidant machinery by 28-homobrassinolide in Brassica juncea L. under salt stress
Induction of oxidative stress occurs under salt stress, which enables the production of ROS. Plants have evolved an elaborate system of antioxidants which help to scavenge these indigenously generated reactive oxygen species. Brassinosteroides (BRs) are sixth class of plant hormones which influence number of physiological and morphological processes in plants and play diverse role in plant growth and development. The present work was conducted to study the effect of 28- homobrassinolide (homoBL) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) content of 30 day old plants of Brassica juncea L. subjected to180 mM salt stress. The seeds of Brassica juncea var. RLC-1 were presoaked in different concentrations of 28-homoBL (10-6, 10-9, 10-12 M) for 8 hours. Finding of the present study revealed that application of 28-homoBL enhanced the antioxidants level in salt stressed plants of Brassica juncea L. which was found to be provide tolerance against extreme salt stress.
