Importance of geology in construction and prevent the hazards
The excess molar volume VE and viscosity coefficient of the binary mixtures of 1-propanol-, 2-methyl-2-propanol-, and 1–hexanol- with hexane over the whole composition range have been measured at five different temperatures (298.15, 303.15, 308.15, 313.15 and 318.15)K and atmospheric pressure. The observed values of the VE for the mixtures can be explained in terms of the (i) dissociation of the associated polar molecules, (ii) dipole-induced dipole interaction between the polar and non-polar molecules, (iii) repulsive electronic force between the components and (iv) geometric effect due to differences in molar volumes. The VE data have been fitted by the least square method to the five parameter Redlich-Kister equation and values of the parameter Aj have been reported. The excess viscosities hE of all the mixtures are negative and have minima at around 0.40, 0.2 and 0.10 respectively mole fractions for x1 of hexane. The values both hE and interaction parameter d have been explained in the light of the observation of Nigam and Mahl. The free energies for viscous flow DG¹ and the excess free energies for viscous flow DG¹E has been calculated from the equation of Eyring
