Physicochemical and microbiological assessment of borehole waters in Umudike, Ikwuano L. G. A., Abia State, Nigeria
Physicochemical and microbial analyses were carried out on the borehole waters in Umudike to examine the quality of the water. Parameters like Taste, Odour, pH, Temperature, Electrical conductivity, Total dissolved oxygen, Biochemical oxygen demand, Hardness, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, Cd2+, Fe2+ as well as microbial analysis were analyzed using their various standard methods. The results showed the values in the range; pH (4.46-5.55mg/l), conductivity (0.33-5.28 us/cm), TDS (0.00-0.008), DO (3.94-4.80), BOD (4.81-6.54), Cl- (1.73– 2.81), Ca2+(0.62-2.88), Mg2+(0.28-1.44), Cd2+(0.009-0.052). These results were compared with the WHO standards for drinking water and found to be within the tolerable limits, with the exception of Cd2+ that was above the tolerable limits of WHO. Microbial analysis carried out indicated the presence of coliforms though there was no cause for concern as they fell within the standards for coliform in water.
