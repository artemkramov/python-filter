Preparation of nano-ammoniated ammonium carnallite from using industrial effluents and saline
Precipitation of magnesium hydroxide from magnesium chloride (Saline) followed by calcination, is important method for production of magnesium oxide and magnesium metal. The chemical purity of magnesium produced is dependent on composition of saline and industrial effluents. To precipitate and recover magnesium hydroxide from solution containing magnesium salts,a strong base is needed (like ammonia). Anhydrous magnesium chloride is used in magnesium metal production such as in production of metallic compounds and to enhance the productivity of olefin polymers such as cordierite, forsterite, enstatite spinel which are used in various industries. In this work the high pH (10.5 – 14) in chemical fertilizer company effluents rich with (ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate) and a mixed streams effluent were used to prepare magnesium chloride, anhydrous magnesium chloride and magnesium oxide. The (XRD) x-rays diffraction and (FT-IR) Infra- red and (EDS) scan electron microscope analysis (TEM) high resolution surface analysis shows the extent of purity, crystal size and magnesium carnallite yield. The products were aged at 50 ºC for 30 min and calcined at 500 ºC to produce magnesium oxide. The ammonium chloride products were reacted with ammonium carnallite which is then calcined at 700 ºC to produce ammoniated ammonium carnallite. The carnallite was characterized by TEM, TGA and EDS. The product is used in magnesium metal preparation
