Influence of heat transfer on peristaltic transport of a Newtonian fluid with wall properties in an asymmetric channel
The effect of heat transfer on the peristaltic transport of a Newtonian fluid with wall properties in a two dimensional flexible channel under long wave length approximation has been studied. A perturbation method of solution is obtained in terms of wall slope parameter and closed form of expressions has been derived for stream function, temperature and heat transfer coefficient. The effects of elastic parameters and pertinent parameters on temperature and the coefficient of heat transfer have been computed numerically. It is observed that temperature distribution increases with increase in elasticity parameters
