Synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystalline powder prepared by sol-gel technique using TiO2 powder reagent
TiO2 is the potential candidate as semiconductor because of its high photochemical stability and low cost. properties are size dependent and when the particle size is reduced to the nano-meter scales it shows some novel properties. in this paper we have prepared nanocrystalline TiO2 powder using sol-gel technique. In this experiment we have used TiO2 powder and acetic acid to prepare sol of TiO2 with DI water and gel was prepared using nitric acid. There are many reports on nanocrystalline TiO2 using solutions of titanium isopropoxide, but here we are reporting the formation of nanocrystalline TiO2 from the TiO2 micro size powder reagent. The uniqueness of this report is the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 powder by sol gel technique using micro size TiO2 powder reagent as starting material
