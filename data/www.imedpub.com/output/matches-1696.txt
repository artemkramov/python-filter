Survey of radon concentration in drinking water samples of Hoshiarpur and Ropar districts of Punjab, India
A survey of radon concentration in drinking water samples in Hoshiarpur and Ropar districts of Punjab, India, has been conducted. A total of 54 samples from the two districts were analysed for dissolved radon using solid state alpha based detector RAD7. The concentration of radon has been found to be varying from 8.7 pCi/L to 123.2 pCi/L in Hoshiarpur district while the values lie in the range from 12.1 pCi/L to 130.6 pCi/L for Ropar district. Assessment of radiation dose due to ingestion of radon from drinking water and associated cancer risk has been made. Water samples were also analysed for other parameters such as pH, Conductivity and TDS and Salinity to assess the overall quality of drinking water of the study area. All the measured parameters were found to be within the permissible limits.
