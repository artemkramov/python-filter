Effects of chemical reaction, radiation and thermo-diffusion on convective heat and mass transfer flow of a viscous dissipated fluid in a vertical channel with constant heat flux
We made attempt in this paper to study thermo-diffusion effect on non-Darcy convective heat and Mass transfer flow of a viscous fluid through a porous medium in a vertical channel with Radiation and heat generating sources. The governing equations flow, heat and mass transfer are solved by using regular perturbation method with δ, the porosity parameter as a perturbation parameter. The velocity, temperature, concentration, shear stress and rate of Heat and Mass transfer are evaluated numerically for different variations of parameter.
