Electrical resistivity survey of a waste dumpsite at Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria
Electrical resistivity measurements was conducted at an old waste dumpsite in Uyo Local Government Area to determine leachate contamination to soils, and it’s possible contamination to subsurface groundwater. Twenty vertical electric sounding (VES) lines were measured in a grid format spaced at about 50m intervals. The equipment used was the Abem Terrameter “SAS 1000”, the data was analysed using computer processed methods with the following softwares Zoody software, surface 9.0, and 3D field pro programmes. The analysis indicate that there was leachate contaminant at the dumpsite with a very low resistivity of 4.5ohms-9.5ohms which infiltrated to depths of 3.5m-5.1m within the top layer. The result indicate that the leachate was localized at about 50m from the dumpsite and is spreading in the direction of the groundwater flow.
