Synthesis Spectral, Thermal Stability and Bacterial Activity of Schiff Bases Derived From Selective Amino Acid and Their Complexes
Different Schiff bases (L) ligands derived from the condensation reaction of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde and some amino acid (DL- Alanine, DL-Phenyalalinane and DL-valine) have been synthesized by using microwave irradiation. Their Ni (II), Zn (II), Cd (II), Cu (II) and Co(III) complexes have been prepared. The ligands are characterized based on elemental analysis, FT-IR, mass spectrometry and 1HNMR. Metal complexes are characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, 1HNMR, molar conductance and thermogravemetric (TG/DG) analysis. Ligands acts as bidentate coordinating with, 1:2 [M:L]. These complexes are [M [L]<sub>2</sub>]. H<sub>2</sub>O for [M=Cd (II),Ni(II),Zn(II) Cu II], [Cd[L]<sub>2</sub>].2H<sub>2</sub>O, [Zn[L]<sub>2</sub>].3H<sub>2</sub>O and [Ni[L]<sub>2</sub>[H<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>2</sub>].H<sub>2</sub>O using their carboxylate oxygen's. Another complexes are prepared from these ligands and they act as bidentate when they coordinating with Co (III) by using their carboxylate oxygen's and the azomithane nitrogen. The ratio are 1:3 [M:L]. The complexes are prepared with formula Co (L)<sub>3</sub>].2H<sub>2</sub>O and [Co (L)<sub>3</sub>]. H<sub>2</sub>O. The thermogravemetric (TG / DG) analysis for one complex was studied and also the antibacterial activity of these ligands and there complexes were tested against some bacteria.
