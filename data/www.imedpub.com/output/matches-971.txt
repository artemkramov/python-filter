Biochemical Effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa Calyx Extracts on the Reproductive Hormones of Male Wistar Rat
Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn. (Roselle) is an annual shrub which is popular in Asia and African countries including Nigeria. It is used as a medicinal plant for the treatment of various disease conditions. This study was undertaken to investigate the biochemical effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract on male rat reproductive hormones. Twenty (20) male Wistar rats weighing between 100 g-200 g were grouped into a control group and three experimental groups. While the water control group received 1.0 ml of water for 28 days, the experimental groups were administered 250 mg/kg oral doses of aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa calyx. The effect of the extract on the basal levels of follicle stimulating hormone, Testosterone, Prolactin, Luteinizing hormone and Estradiol were conducted in experimental animals. The 28 days administration of aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa L. is associated with decreased circulating plasma levels of follicle stimulating hormone, Testosterone, Luteinizing hormone and Prolactin in male wistar rat compared with the control group. The study did not show a significant change in the plasma levels Estradiol following 28 days oral administration of H. sabdariffa calyx to the experimental animal. The study concluded that H. sabdariffa calyx extract at a dose of 250 mg/kg caused mild effects on rat reproductive hormones.
