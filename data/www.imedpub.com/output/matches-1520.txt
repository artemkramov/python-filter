Determination of water quality index of river Asa, Ilorin, Nigeria
Rivers are indispensible freshwater systems that are necessary for the continuation of life. The aim of the study was to assess some physicochemical parameters (pH, Dissolved oxygen, Temperature, Turbidity, Total dissolved solid, Nitrate, Ammonia, Iron, Lead and Chromium) of river Asa and present the complex water quality data of the river in a form that can easily be understood by the technical and non-technical personnel. To achieve the aim, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) was applied on the analytical results of the parameters to obtain a single value that was used to rank the river at each of the sampling station. The results (41.3, 42.3, and 43.6, 52.9) of the Water Quality Index showed that three of the four stations investigated can be ranked as poor and the remaining one as marginal. The implication is that the river failed Drinking Water Quality Index and thus not suited as a source of drinking water.
