Semiconducting and Chelating Applications of newly Synthesized Terpolymer
Terpolymer resin p-COF-II was synthesized by the condensation of p-Cresol (p-C) and oxamide (O) with formaldehyde (F) in the presence of 2M HCl as catalyst with 2:1:3 molar ratios of reacting monomers. The electrical properties of p-COF-II terpolymer were measured over a wide range of temperature (313-423K), activation energy of electrical conduction has been evaluated and plot of log s vs 103/T is found to be linear over a wide range of temperature, which can be ranked it as semiconductor. The chelating ion-exchange properties of this terpolymer was studied for Fe (III), Cu (II), Ni (II), Co (II), Zn (II), Cd (II) and Pb (II) ions. A batch equilibrium method was employed in the study of the selectivity of metal ion uptake. The study was carried out over a wide pH range, shaking time and in media of various ionic strengths. The terpolymer showed a higher selectivity for Fe (III), Cu (II), and Ni (II) ions than for Co (II), Zn (II), Cd (II) and Pb (II) ions.
