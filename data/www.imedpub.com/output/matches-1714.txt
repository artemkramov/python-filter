Evaluation of groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking purposes in Gunthakal Area, Ananthapur District, Andhra Pradesh, India
The suitability of groundwater quality for drinking purpose was assessed in the rural areas of Gunthakal area based on the various water quality parameters. Fifteen groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness (TH), total dissolved solids (TDS), anions (F-, NO3 -, HCO3 -, SO4 2-) and cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+). Fluoride concentrations ranged up to 2 mg/l, and average concentrations varied from 1.07 mg/L. Nitrate concentrations ranged up to 68.40 mg/l, and average 22.21 mg/l in the study area.
