Phytoplankton composition in relation to hydrochemical properties of certain floodplain Riparian wetlands of river Subansiri of North Eastern India
A limnological investigation was carried out in Certain Floodplain Riparian Wetlands of River Subansiri of North Eastern India from June 2013 to May 2014. Water quality parameters like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, free carbon dioxide, chloride, nitrate and phytoplankton composition were investigated during the study period. Correlation coefficients were calculated among the various physicochemical variables and phytoplankton groups. Pearson Product Analysis for phytoplankton at the two sites was performed and it showed a high significance of Bacillariophyceae members between both the sites than other groups. A total of 46 species were identified belonging to Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae. Moreover, species of Chlorophyceae were recorded to be the most occurred group compared to others throughout the study which shows relatively unpolluted nature of wetland
