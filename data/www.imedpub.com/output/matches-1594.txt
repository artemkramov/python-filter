Principles and content of right to environment (in the light of international documents and conventions)
In the second half of the twentieth century, we are witnessing development of concerns related to human rights and violation of these rights in different aspects. Thus in order to prevent the violation of these rights the international society has made some attempts; including ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and two agreements on Political and Civil Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. But alongside these international actions and attempts, new necessities have been created and consequently, new rights have been added to the other human rights. The need for existence of a developed society in different fields of economic, social, cultural and…proposed right to development. Need for a healthy environment alongside other human rights and considering threats that human development and industry have made against environment, created right to healthy environment. In the early sixties, new generation of human rights were noted gradually and seriously and came to existence as correlative rights (the third generation of human rights) i.e. those rights that by international assistance and participation of all international institutions and governments achieving these rights would be possible to some extent. The present research intends to study the principles and content of right to environment with regard to international conventions and documents for the purpose of adequate recognition of right to environment as one of the third generation of human rights’ (correlative rights) instances.
