Geochemical characterization of Afikpo Basin, Arochukwu Area, South East, Nigeria
Geochemical analyses were carried out on shale samples obtained from a well in the Arochukwu Area, Afikpo Basin, to determine the TOC and SOM values. The TOC values varied from 0.85wt% - 1.15wt% with an average of 1.03wt%, while the SOM values ranged from 20ppm – 480ppm with an average of 120.5 ppm. The above results show that the TOC values fall above the minimum threshold for hydrocarbon generation potential. The minimum threshold value for TOC is 0.5%. The average SOM value of 120.5 ppm which is higher than the minimum value which is 50 ppm is also indicative of good source rock potential for the studied samples. The transformation ratio which serves as a quantitative analysis to determine the level of maturity shows an average value of 12.4 which indicate that studied samples of the area are immature . The implication, therefore, is that the sediments from the studied depth slice can be regarded as immature sediment in predominantly gas prone enviroment.
