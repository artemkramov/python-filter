Vermicomposting of biogas plant slurry and cow dung with Eudrilus eugeniae and its effects on Vigna radiata
Vermicomposting is a biological process for the management of solid wastes and animal excreta. The present study was undertaken to produce vermicompost from biogas plant slurry (BPS) mixing with cow dung using Eudrilus eugeniae. The quality of prepared compost was compared with control and its yield potential was evaluated in the field experiments of Vigna radiata. The results revealed that germination of seeds, root length, shoot length, number of root hairs, numbers of leaves were well enhanced with the application of compost from biogas plant slurry and cow dung mixture. It is concluded that the vermicompost from BPS and Cow dung mixture was superior in promoting the plant growth
