Study of physico-chemical characterization of irrigation tanks and fishponds of Gujarat by statistical analysis
This study analyzed seasonal variation in physico-chemical parameters from the data collected at 7 irrigation tanks and 2 village fish ponds at 2 sites from 2000-2001. The data was analyzed statistically using multifactorial correlation analysis in order to study the inter-relationship of 10 parameters of 2 sites of the seven irrigation tanks and two village fishponds of Balasinor taluka, Matar taluka of Kheda district and Tarapur taluka of Anand district of Gujarat. The impact of various seasons on water quality of 10 physico-chemical parameters like pH, Total Alkalinity, Dissolved Oxygen, Free Co2, Calcium, Magnesium, Hardness, Chloride, Sulphate and Inorganic Phosphate of irrigation tanks and village fishponds was assessed by multifactorial statistical analysis.
