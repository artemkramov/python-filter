Assessment of heavy metals level in cassava flour sold in Anyigba Market Kogi State, Nigeria
Kogi State, North Central Nigeria is a food basket state has several food items obtained from her rich agricultural soil which when harvested are transported to the markets raw or in processed form. Cassava flours processed locally and sold in Anyigba market were screened for mineral elements using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Flour samples were obtained at random from different cassava flour sellers, processed and analyzed. Mineral elements analyzed for were K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu and Mn. Heavy metals Pb, Co and Cd were also determined. Potassium was analysed using flame photometer. Sample A has the highest level of K and Mg of 6.71μg/g and 4.84μg/g respectively while sample B showed the lowest level of K and Mg assayed 4.8μg/g and 1.18μg/g respectively. The heavy metals Pb, Co and Cd screened for were below detection limit. Mn was as low as 0.01μg/g in sample A and D. Results of the HCN showed that sample C have concentration value of 14.7ppm and D recorded 15.4ppm. These values were above WHO permissible limit cyanide concentration of 10.0ppm. Moisture and ash contents were also determined.
