Effect of bi addition on physical properties of Ge12Se88-xBix glassy semiconductors
Reversible switching phenomenon in certain types of chalcogenide glasses a lot of attention has been given to characterization and improvement of the properties of chalcogenide glasses in general and the materials exhibiting the switching phenomenon in particular. In the present work, the effect on the physical properties with the variation in bismuth content has been studied theoretically for Ge12Se88-xBix (x=3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 at. %) glassy alloys. It has been found that almost all the parameters, studied here, vary linearly with the increase in Bi content, thus making this suitable for phase change optical recording.
