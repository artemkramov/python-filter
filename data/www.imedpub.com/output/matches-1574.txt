In vitro micropropagation of Enicostema axillare
Rapid propagation of Enicostema was achieved in vitro. A vary rate of multiple shoot was obtained with 0.5 BAP, 0.2 mg/l IAA sucrose 3% and 0.6% agar. Multiple shoots were initiated from nodal explants on Murashinge and Skoog medium, supplemented with BAP, IAA and Adinine. Good shooting response was observed when individual regenerated shoots were inoculated on to MS with 0.5 mg/l BAP + 0.2 mg/l IAA + 10mg Adinine and 3% sucrose. Maximum rooting response was observed with 0.6 mg/l NAA+ 1mg/l IBA concentration. Such planlets successfully transferred to soil after hardening with high rate of survival.
