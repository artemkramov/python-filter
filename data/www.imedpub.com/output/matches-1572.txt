Isolation and characterization of sulphated polysaccharides from Codium tomentosum (J. Stackhouse, 1797) collected from southeast coast of India
A sulphated polysaccharide was isolated from Codium tomentosum by hot-water extraction, deproteinized, precipitation with ethanol, and obtained a crude polysaccharides yield from 24.2% based on dry weight source. The crude polysaccharides further fractionated by anion-exchange column chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column, fractionation yielded was 17.31%, and purified by gel-permeation chromatography using Sephadex G-50 Fast Flow column they were yielded from 10.83% respectively. The biochemical composition of the sulphated polysaccharides contains total carbohydrate 88.7%, sulfate 14.7%, protein 0%, ash 15.9% and moisture 2.3% respectively. The FT-IR spectral analysis of the sulphated polysaccharides consist carboxyls and sulfate groups. The elemental analysis of sulphated polysaccharides possess higher amount of carbon at 25.86%, hydrogen 5.80%, nitrogen 6.50% and very less in sulfur at 0.16% respectively. The present study was concluded the sulphated polysaccharides would be in useful product development and bioprospecting approaches
