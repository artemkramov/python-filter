Studies on isolation of nutritional grouping streptomycetes from fishes
As far as fishes of three environmental biotopes – marine (Epinephelus diacanthus [grouper]), estuarine (Oreochromis mossambicus [Tilapia]) and fresh-water (Cyprinus carpio [common carp]) are concerned , which have wider association with muddy soils. The nutrient rich diversity provided the fish with all required habitats. Here we studied the interaction or association of microbes particularly Streptomyces spp in the gut of fishes of three environmental biotopes and their ability of producing antibacterial components against human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. This proves that these extracts have the effective antibacterial components production against pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The TLC ‘Rf’ values also exhibited the same. It ranges from 0.40 to 0.78. The bioactive components revealed the maximal U.V absorption peaks ranging from 215 to 300nm.These strains produced either a broad spectrum antimicrobial compounds with different media or nature spectrum for specific target pathogen like, Vibrio cholera. Further investigation is needed in order to determine the structure of active components. In domestic markets, no toxic bio-fungicides and dermatogens do exist. It is a new venture for the development of Biotechnological exploration and exploitation in the years to come.
