Confirmation of seeds polysaccharide structure from Cassia alata Linn. plant by periodate oxidation method
Periodate oxidation is one of the most important reaction in structural study of non-ionic polysaccharide. Periodate oxidation was done using sodium metaperiodate as oxidant proposed by Fluery &amp; Lange’s method. It consumed 1.16 moles of periodate and liberated 0.23 moles of formic acid per mole of anhydrohexose unit after 50 hrs. The isolated water soluble seeds extract yielded sugars as D-galactose and D-mannose in 2:3 molar ratio. The probable polysaccharide structure from Cassia alata Linn. seeds have been elucidated with methylation results was confirmed by the periodate oxidation results
