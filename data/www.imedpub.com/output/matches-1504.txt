Comparative study of 1,4-PÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ointramolecular interaction in hybrid phosphine-phosphoniumylide and their Hg(II) derivatives
Inter and intramolecular interactions are important in the context of conformational preferences, molecular reactivity and supramolecular chemistry. The extent of 1, 4 P…O intramolecular interaction present in the solid state structures of a special class of phosphine appended phosphorus ylide ligand and its Hg(II) derivatives were examined. While halogen ligands around mercury ion seem to affect the P, O nonbonding distances, the P-C-C-O torsion angles are less influenced. Comparison of the geometrical parameters indicates the preference for cisoid conformation in solid state.
