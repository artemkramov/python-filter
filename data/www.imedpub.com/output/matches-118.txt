MHD free convection heat and mass transfer flow through a porous medium bounded by a vertical surface in presence of hall current
In this paper the effects of hall current, chemical reaction and radiation on a free convection flow bounded by a vertical surface embedded in porous medium under the influence of uniform magnetic field which is applied normal to the surface is studied. The problem is solved analytically and the expressions for velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction and rate of heat and mass transfer are derived and the effects of various physical parameters like Magnetic parameter M, radiation parameter F, Grashof number Gr, modified Grashof number Gm, Prandtl number Pr, permeability parameter k and the chemical reaction parameter k0 are studied though graphs and tables. It is observed that the velocity and concentration increase during a generative reaction and decrease in a destructive reaction. The same is true for the behavior of the fluid temperature. The presence of magnetic field and radiation diminishes the velocity and also the temperature.
