Diversity of macrofungi in Ã¢ÂÂJalukbari reserve forestÃ¢ÂÂ of Kamrup District, Assam
A study on seasonal diversity of macrofungi was conducted for two consecutive years (2010-2012) in Jalukbari reserve forest of Kamrup district of Assam. As a result of the study, different macrofungi were reported representing 38 species, 28 genera and 19 families. Maximum species were saprophytic (28) in nature inhabiting the dead logs, leaf litter, compost etc. while 3 species were mycorrhizal with trees. Only 2 species were parasitic while 2 species were termitophilic. Maximum frequency of occurrence was exhibited by Schizophyllum commune (50%) and also the the highest density was of the same species(4.44). Lentinus polychrous was the most abundant species (12.33).Species Richness Indexwas highest in rainy season (4.57)followed by summer season (1.57) and winter (0.84). Currently there is no evidence on the status of macro fungi of this part of the state. Regarding the importance of fungi in various aspects of life and for the conservation purpose, the present study has been undertaken.
