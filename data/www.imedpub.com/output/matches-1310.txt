A novel approach to the synthesis of aryldithiocarbamic acid esters with arylamines and CS2 in aqueous media
An efficient, novel and highly simple procedure for the direct synthesis of aryl dithiocarbamates from the one-pot reaction of amines, carbon disulfide, and alkyl halides, without the use of any catalyst and aqueous condition at room temperature.
