Determination of stability constant of substituted thiopyrimidine drugs
Substituted thiopyrimidine drugs are synthesize in laboratory by reported method. The physic-chemical study of substituted thiopyrimidine carried out by pH-metric method by considering their interaction with Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal ions at 0.1 M ionic strength in 70 % DMF-water mixture by Bjerrum method as adopted by Calvin and Wilson. These study useful to understand type of complex formation between transition metal ion and thiopyrimine drugs(L1 and L2). Present work deals with determination and comparison of stability constant
