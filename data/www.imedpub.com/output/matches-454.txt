Graft copolymerization of methyl acrylate on chitosan: Initiated by ceric ammonium nitrate as the initiator-characterization and antimicrobial activity
Methyl acrylate was grafted onto chitosan by using the ceric ammonium nitrate as the initiator. The effect of initiator concentration, monomer concentration, time &amp; temperature on % G and % E were studied. The grafted samples were characterized using FTIR, SEM, TGA methods. Evidence of grafting was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The morphology evaluated by SEM. The thermal analysis indicated the different stages of the degradation of the grafted copolymer. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the grafted polymer have also been investigated. The grafting compound was applied onto chitosan initiated by ceric ion at 1 wt. % add and was found to have a good antimicrobial and antifungal performance.
