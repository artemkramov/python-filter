Mass transfer effects on MHD unsteady free convective WalterÃ¢ÂÂs memory flow with constant suction and heat sink through porous media
The aim of the present work is to study the influence of mass transfer on unsteady hydromagnetic free convective memory flow of incompressible and electrically conducting fluids past an infinite vertical porous plate in the presence of constant suction and heat absorbing sink through porous medium. Approximate solutions have been derived for the mean velocity, mean temperature and mean concentration using multi-parameter perturbation technique and these are presented in graphical form. The effects of different physical parameters such as magnetic parameter, Grashof number, modified Grashof number, Prandtl number, Schmidt number, Eckert number and heat sink strength parameter are discussed.
