Investigation of the biogas production potentials of Bambara nut chaff (Vigna Subterranea)
An investigation of the biogas production potentials of Bambara nut chaff (Vigna Subterranea) (BNC) was carried out. The waste was charged into a metal prototype digester of 50L capacity in a ratio of 2:1 of water to waste, under mesophilic temperature range of 24° - 37°C and within a retention period of 22 days. Results obtained showed that the BNC had a cumulative biogas production of 4.04 L/kg. slurry and mean biogas yield of 0.18± 0.09 L/kg. slurry. The onset of gas flammability took place on the 10th day though it discontinued after five days. The gas production also stopped after 19 days (giving effective retention time of 19 days). The result of the microbial total viable count (TVC) showed zero count at the end of the digestion showing that the microbes died. Overall results indicate that Bambara nut chaff has the potentials to generate biogas but would require some form of treatment to optimize its biogas production.
