Effect of nitrogen fertilizer sources and foliar spray of humic and/or fulvic acids on yield and quality of rice plants
To study the effect of nitrogen fertilizer sources and foliar spray of organic acids on rice crop, In this regard, this test was performed in 2010 and 2011 years at El- Gemmeiza Agricultural Research Station, El-Gharbia Governorate located at lat. 30.47, long 31.00 and 14.80 m above the mean sea; the used design was split plot randomized complete block with 3replications. Main plots, two nitrogen fertilizer sources: anhydrous ammonia &amp; urea while subplots, were treated with foliar application of humic and / or fulvic acid resulting 4 treatments including: controls (without foliar spray), humic, fulvic and humic +fulvic acids were considered.
