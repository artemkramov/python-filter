Human-Sloth Bear Conflict: Causes and Mitigation Measures in Kota,Rajasthan, India
The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) is now considered as endangered by IUCN red list of 2011. In wild habitat it is considered as the most dangerous wild animal because it is unpredictable and often attacks on human in forests. In the present investigation human sloth bear conflicts were studied in Kota district of Rajasthan, using forest department records, interviews with villagers and surveys within sloth bear habitat. Most of the casualties can be reduced by restricting human entries into sloth bear habitats, avoiding camping and housing in their habitats especially near water sources. Road accidents are also very common in the present study area as there is a National Highway near the forest area. Active management with local inhabitants will support the conservation of sloth bear.
