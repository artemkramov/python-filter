Peristaltic transport in an inclined asymmetric channel with heat and mass transfer by Adomian decomposition method
In this paper, the peristaltic transport in an inclined asymmetric channel with heat and mass transfer by Adomian decomposition method has been studied. The flow is examined in a wave frame of reference moving with the velocity of wave and the resulting equations have then been simplified using the assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximation. The reduced equations have been solved numerically and the exact solutions have also been computed for velocity, temperature and concentration. The effects of various parameters of interest on these formulas were discussed and illustrated graphically through a set of graphs.
