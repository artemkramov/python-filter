Radiation and chemical reaction effects on free convection MHD flow through a porous medium bounded by vertical surface
Chemical reaction and radiation effects on free convection MHD flow through a porous medium bounded by vertical surface is studied here. The fluid considered is gray, absorbing-emitting radiation but a non-scattering medium. The governing equations involved in the present analysis are solved by the two-term perturbation method. The velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction and Nusselt number are studied for different parameters like thermal Grashof number, mass Grashof number, Schmidt number, magnetic field parameter, permeability parameter, Prandtl number, radiation parameter, Eckert number and chemical reaction parameter.
