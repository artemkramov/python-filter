HAM for finding solutions to coupled system of variable coefficient equations arising in fluid dynamics
The present paper applies the homotopy analysis method (HAM) for finding solutions to a coupled system of variable coefficient equations that arise in the problems of fluid dynamics. Flow of fluids particularly nonnewtonian fluids through pipes is a problem that has wide range of application. The mathematical formulations of these problems generally give rise to non-linear (and/or) coupled (and/ or) variable coefficient equations. Thus finding exact solutions of these problems is almost impossible. Thus researchers sought to numerical or approximate analytical method for solving them. Here, in the present study, the flow of micropolar fluid in a rigid circular tube is considered and an approximate analytical solution is found. The effect of the fluid flow parameter, micro rotation parameter and the pressure gradient on the velocity and micro rotation of the fluid are studied. The results are presented through graphs
