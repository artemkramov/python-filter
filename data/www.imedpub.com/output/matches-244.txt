Impacts of Exploitation and Gas Pipelines on Soils Along Qua Iboe River Estuary of Onna, Southeastern Nigeria
Exploitations are the major threat to the environment of Ikot Ebidang. An overview of the impacts of gas pipeline management activities on soil erosion and productivity was investigated in this community. The present soil condition shows that inherent low fertility status is seldom the cause of greatly reduced site productivity. However, erosion, in combination with other site factors, works to degrade productivity on a large scale. Extreme disturbances, such as excavation and logging, cause the loss of nutrients, and organic matter. These combined losses reduce long-term site productivity and may lead to sustained periods of extended erosion that could exacerbate degradation
