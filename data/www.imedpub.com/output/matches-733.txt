Effect of refuse dumps on ground water quality
order to achieve this, water samples were obtained during dry and wet seasons from hand dug well. Hand dug wells were selected close to the dumps site. pH and conductivity were determined using pH/conductivity meter, TDS, Ca, Cl, P, Ni, total hardness, DO, BOD were determined using standard method. Most the values are within the permissible limit but the all samples are not in conformity with WHO limit for bacteriological values which make the water to be unsafe for drinking, further treatment is recommended for the water. The study concludes that the hand dug well water around the refuse dumps sites are not safe human consumption.
