FTIR studies of hydrogen bonding interaction between the hydroxyl and carbonyl liquids
The intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between p-chlorophenol and amyl acetate has been investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. This article mainly reports the results of p-chlorophenol with carbon tetrachloride solution and in the presence of amyl acetate. The spectroscopic characteristics of OH….O complexes are specified. Also, the formation constant for 1:1 and 1:2 complexes at 25o C were evaluated by the methods of Nash, Whetsel-Kagaraise and Becker. The free energy of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes were obtained from the formation constant values. The formation constant and free energy values indicate that existence of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes
