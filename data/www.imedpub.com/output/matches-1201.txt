Growth and characterization of strontium doped cadmium tartrate crystal by gel method
This paper presents the growth and characterization of Strontium Doped Cadmium Tartrate Crystal grown by Gel method. The structural properties are investigated by XRD and SEM. The optical parameters were studied by UVVIS. The fictional group is investigated by using the FTIR spectrum. The elemental composition is determined by EDAX analysis. The XRD analysis reveals that the grown samples are polycrystalline and tetragonal in phase. The SEM images show the platy structure. The optical band gap is estimated as 5.63eV.
