Regional implication of tropospheric surface refractivity on radio propagation (A case study of Nigerian atmosphere)
The wet and dry constituents of the atmosphere affect the propagation of microwave signals especially in the Troposphere. The variations of tropospheric surface refractivity in four cities, (Nsukka, Akure, Minna and Sokoto) modeling Nigerian atmosphere were investigated. The data of 2008 measured on two levels, 0 m (ground level) and 100m altitude of the troposphere captured with the vantage Pro II automatic weather station procured from Centre for Basic Space Science (CBSS), UNN Nsukka were analyzed. The results of the investigation revealed that each Region, namely: Coastal, Inland, Central and far North exhibits a peculiar characteristics that has serious implication on Radiopropagation and receptivity of microwave signal such that ignoring the characteristics could precipitate socio-economic problems of inestimable magnitude. There is high value of refractivity in the coastal region, a reason for the heightening of energy of propagation. It can possibly generate loss of communication and also social insecurity. This Paper, therefore, seeks to itemize step-by -step these implications with a view to proffer suggestions towards aversion or at least ameliorating the effects on human socio-economic relations
