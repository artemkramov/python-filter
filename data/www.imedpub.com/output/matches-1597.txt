Physical habitat quality assessment of three ephemeral streams of Lakhimpur, north-eastern India
This work was, mainly, intended to assess the habitat quality in relation to seasonal variation. Studied three streams were remaining dry during winter and pre monsoon season. A numeric evaluation of habitat by assessing 8 components of habitat was measured using a scoring system of 1 to 20 points for each parameter showed that ranking status of all the three ephemeral streams was optimal
