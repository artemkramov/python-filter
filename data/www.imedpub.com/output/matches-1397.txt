Assessment of molecular genetic diversity in some green gram cultivars as revealed by ISSR analysis
Molecular marker is a useful tool for assessing genetic variation and resolving cultivar identities. The objective of the present study was to assess the extent of genetic diversity and reveal the phylogenetic relationships among the 5 green gram varieties based on DNA data. A total number of 10 ISSR primers that produced polymorphic and reproducible fragments were selected to amplify genomic DNA of the mung bean genotypes under investigation. Ten primers amplified a total number of 353 bands under 93 loci across five genotypes. The cultivars exhibited an overall polymorphism of 52.69%. The value of Jacaard’s similarity coefficient ranged from 0.724 to 0.793. The five mung bean cultivars were grouped into 3 clusters at 72.4 per cent similarity. In comparison to other cultivars, Panna showed most genetic variability, suggesting utilization of this species over others for breeding programme and in transferring the characters into different mung bean cultivars. Overall a moderate degree of genetic diversity among the mung bean cultivars was recorded. Nevertheless, the reasonable diversity observed in this study may be exploited for further yield improvement
