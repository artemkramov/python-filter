Comparative study of groundwater from basaltic and granitic aquifers of Dharmabad Taluka of Nanded District, Maharashtra
The study was carried out the physicochemical characteristics of groundwaters from basaltic and granitic aquifers of Dharmabad taluka of Nanded District, Maharashtra (India). The water samples were collected from various regions of basaltic and granitic aquifers of Dharmabad during 2009 in pre monsoon season. The physico-chemical parameters such as pH, EC, total dissolved solids, hardness, alkalinity as well as chloride, sulphate, nitrates, sodium potassium and fluoride have been analyzed. Majority of the samples do not comply with BIS for most of the water quality parameters measured. The fluoride concentration in the groundwater of these villages was recorded upto 2 mg/l, causing dental fluorosis among people especially children of these villages. The nitrates concentration varied from 19.5 to 190 mg/l. Overall water quality was found unsatisfactory for drinking purposes without any prior treatment in maximum samples.
