Influence of heat transfer on MHD oscillatory flow of Jeffrey fluid in a channel
In this paper, Influence of heat transfer on MHD oscillatory flow of Jeffrey fluid in a channel is investigated. The effects of various emerging parameters on the velocity field and temperature field are discussed in detail through graphs.
