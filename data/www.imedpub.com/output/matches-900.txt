Green route synthesis of stable isotropic gold nanoparticles using leaf extract of Curcuma longa and their characterization
In this work, the facile green route synthesis of ultra-stable, spherical Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) has been demonstrated by the simple green biosynthesis method reducing Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4). This investigation described; use of farm-fresh leaves of Curcuma longa plant for green biosynthesis of extremely stable isotropic and monodisperse GNPs. The stability of the GNPs was found to be up to 10.27 M, when tested using 5M NaCl solution. The Flocculation Parameter (FP) value was found to be max up to 0.92 P. The size of the GNPs found to be ranging from 10 nm to 30 nm with average size of 20 nm. The best parameters for the synthesis of GNPs were; fifty folds diluted leaf extract, 100ºC; at pH 6.68 of leaf extract, and 100 ppm HAuCl4. The GNPs were characterized and investigated by ultraviolet-visible (U.V.-Visible) spectrophotometry, Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM); Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-rays (EDAX)
