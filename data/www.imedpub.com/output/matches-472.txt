Soil pH, microbial population, nitrate reductase and alkaline phosphatase activities of different environment of Dibrugarh district, Assam
The present paper reported the soil pH, microbial population, nitrate reductase and alkaline phosphatase activities of five different types of soil environments of Dibrugarh district. Soil pH was ranging between 5.40-7.02. Microbial population was found to be more in tea garden soil (4.6 x 105) and less in rice field soil (3.4 x 105). Rice field soil showed more nitrate reductase activity (11.09 μg/ml/hr ), while botanical garden soil showed higher alkaline phosphatase activity (26.40 μg/ml/hr). Isolation, characterization and identification of microbes from soil with higher alkaline phosphatase activity and their proper culture and implementation as a source of bio fertilizer will open a new area in organic cultivation.
