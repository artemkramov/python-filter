The effect of heat treatment on the physical and mechanical properties of the (Alnico-5) alloy prepared by powder metallurgy method
The aim of this work is studying the (Alnico 5) alloy by using powder metallurgy method. Containing after testing by device of atomic absorption (5% Al, 13% Ni, 17% Co, 2% Cu, 63% Fe) Physical properties have been studied at different heat treatment temperatures (Apparent Density, Porosity, Water Absorption) and mechanical (Vickers Hardness). The real density and apparent density results show that the ratios of the apparent density less than real density. The mechanical hardness measurement show the increasing in this value corresponding to the decreasing of porosity and water absorption after heat treatment because of grain growth and alloy homogenization.
