Chemical agents in control of dental plaque in dentistry: An overview of current knowledge and future challenges
As dental plaque is generally accepted to be the predominant etiologic factor in gingivitis and periodontal disease and a prerequisite for the development of caries, these observations opened a new field of research on prevention of dental disease. A variety of antiboitics and antiseptics have been a employed as adjuncts to conventional therapies to suppress pathogens ,chemical plaque control could prevent or reverse gingivitis if it, 1) eliminated all plaque; 2) reduced plaque below an individuals threshold for disease 3) altered the bacterial composition of plaque in such a way that health would not convert to disease. This article considers the main chemical agents which have been used as bacterial agents in mouthwash and other vehicles to inhibit growth of the plaque.
