Studies on bioaccumulation of heavy metals and selected minerals from mining effluent contaminated soil treated with fertilizers into Cucurbita pepo vegetable
The present study evaluated bioaccumulation of heavy metals and selected minerals from mining effluent contaminated soil from Ishiagu, Ebonyi State South-East Nigeria treated with fertilizers into Cucurbita pepo vegetable. Effluents of Crush rock, Crush stone and Ezza quarry sites were used for the study. Heavy metals and selected minerals in both soil and vegetable were analysed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Results showed that level of these heavy metals in the soil were more at the discharge points. Results also showed that Cucurbita pepo accumulated considerable amounts of these heavy metals. However, high levels of these heavy metals were found in pots without fertilizers (Sample D) than pots treated with urea (Sample E) and NPK 20.10.10 fertilizers (Sample F). The toxicity of these heavy metals at high levels of exposure is well known, but of a major concern is the possibility that continual exposure at relatively low levels of heavy metals through consumption of Cucurbita pepo vegetable may entail adverse health effects.
