Some aspects of reproductive biology of Apogon quadrifasciatus Cuvier, 1828 collected from the trawling grounds off Visakhapatnam, east coast of India
Sex ratio indicated that there was a significant difference between males and females in their occurrence. Males dominated the catches during the study period. A scale of six stages of maturity of gonads was identified. The length at first maturity was found to be 82 mm in females. Females in length range of 81 to 90 mm formed the spawning population. The GSI has been found to be high during February - April in females. Spawning takes place throughout the year with peak during February to April. Fecundity varied from 1808 to 1967
