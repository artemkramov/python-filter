Coordination compounds on metallic surfaces
Nanotechnology and Nanoscience has started a new era for Coordination Chemistry. It has attracted the attention of researchers to build coordination compounds on a metallic surface like flat surface, electrodes and nanoparticles. Due to this advancement it is possible to prepare nanoscale devices with novel properties. Bottom up approach is used to form the nanoscale functional architecture on a metal surface from the molecular components. Recent advances in this area also addresses the coordination multilayered structure on metal complexes. They are helpful due to their potential application in photo and electrochemical devices. Self assembled monolayers units proceed with the help of metal co-ordination and as a result formation of multilayered structures.
