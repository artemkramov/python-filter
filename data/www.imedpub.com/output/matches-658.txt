Physico-chemical and adsorption studies of activated carbon from Agricultural wastes
It has been widely recognized that dye removal by activated carbon adsorption is due to the surface action between the dye and the functional groups present in the surface of the carbon. An effective usage of the adsorbent necessitates a deeper understanding of the adsorption characteristics. The present study examined the use of modified activated carbon derived from the seeds of widely available plant source of Martynia annua L and Xanthiyam strumarium. A series of activated carbon samples were prepared by subjecting the materials to various chemical processes. The physico-chemical properties and sorption abilities were compared. Adsorption of commercially used dye materials of various concentrations were studied with prepared activated carbon samples from batch tests. These materials accrue superior properties and good adsorption behaviors. The adsorption capacities of four of the selected derived carbon samples were much greater than the capacities of the other carbon. The results reveal that the prepared activated carbon could be employed as a low cost alternative for decolorizing the coloring agents from waste water and industrial effluents.
