Assessment of macro and micro nutrients in alkaline soil from Satpuda region Orange Belt, Maharashtra, India
Most of the essential elements are found in liberal quantities in the mineral soils. The present study deals with the assessment of macronutrients i.e. N, K, Ca, Mg, P, S and micronutrients i.e. Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn from satpuda region of orange belt, Maharashtra, India. Soil samples collected from different locations of the orange belt. The availability of nitrogen according to alkaline permanganate method and phosphorus by olsens method was found to be 243 – 287 Kg/Hector and 13.2 - 15.3 Kg/Hector respectively. Potassium was found to be in medium rang. Organic carbon as a measure of available Nitrogen found to be 0.5 %. The data reveals that the soils are rich with K, medium with P and low with N
