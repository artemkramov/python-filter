The influence of hospital wastewater and food samples grown within Ahmadu Bello University teaching hospital, Zaria-Nigeria on its receiving environment
The Microbial analysis were determined within the wastewater treatment Plant to ascertained quantitatively the total Coli-form count and E. Coli, which ranged between 2.5×103 to 2.8×103 MPN/100ml and 2.5×103 to 2.7×103 MPN/100ml respectively. Wastewater and food samples (Cocoyam, Cassava and Tomatoes) were collected from Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital wastewater Treatment Plant and from farmland within the vicinity of the research area. Samples were collected between the period of July 2010 to September 2010, and the mean values of the following parameters were determined: pH temperature, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand(BOD5), Dissolved Oxygen(DO), nitrate, sulphate, phosphate and conductivity. In addition, heavy metals (lead, iron, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, chromium and manganese were determined using AAS after digestion. From the results obtained, the level of temperature is above the World Health Organization limit, while the level of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is below the tolerance limit for the survival of aquatic life in the wastewater. The Microbiological load(bacteria) is highly contaminated in the wastewater and will pose a threat of infection to human health. The level of nitrate and sulphate did not exceed the WHO limits as recommended for hospital wastewater disposal, while the level of phosphate were found to be higher than the WHO limits. All other parameters determined in the wastewater and food sample were lower than the limits set by WHO and the maximum permissible levels.
