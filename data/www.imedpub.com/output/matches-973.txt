Synthesis and characterization of highly efficient copper nanoparticles and their catalytic application in oxidative kinetic study
In the present work, we described the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (Cunps) through a single route of chemical reduction method.The effect of different concentration of reducing agent andtemperature on the morphology of Cunps was investigated. The synthesized copper nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Visible spectrophotometer, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis. The average sizes of copper nanoparticles were found to be 12, 16, 28, 55 nm at different concentration of L-ascorbic acid.The kinetics of copper nanoparticles catalyzed oxidation of glycine (Gly) by peroxodisulphate(PDS) in aqueous medium at 308 K has been studied. The copper nanoparticles catalyst exhibited very good catalytic activity.Interestingly, it was found that, the catalytic activity depends on the size of nanoparticlesand the kinetics of the reaction was found to be first order with respect to peroxodisulphate and independent of glycine concentration. Addition of neutral salts shows a retarding effect
