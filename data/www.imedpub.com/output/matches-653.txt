Near-surface resistivity mapping of Anambra State University, Uli Campus and Environs, Southeastern, Nigeria
This study involves the explicit use of vertical electrical sounding and outcrop data to interpret reliable subsurface geological models. The study area has a terrain that is generally low-lying with spot heights ranging from 32m - 76m. It is underlain by the lithologic members of the Eocene Benin Formation and Recent Alluvium. Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) borne on the Schlumberger array was conducted at 20 locations within the study area. The data plotted as single and multiple layer geoelectric curve types and were delineated as lateritic topsoil, clay, sandstone and gravel. These identified geoelectric sections are consistent with the outcrop logs and borehole data obtained at some selected sites across the area. The results indicate that groundwater can be sufficiently exploited from depth ranges of 30m – 122m with surface discharges as Ubahudara Spring, Ndinwalede Stream, Atammiri River and Usham Lake. This shows to an acceptable degree, the efficacy of integrated VES and outcrop studies in establishing subsurface geological models and groundwater parameters.
