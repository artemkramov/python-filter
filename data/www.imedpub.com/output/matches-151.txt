Effects of radiation on unsteady MHD free convective flow past an oscillating vertical porous plate embedded in a porous medium with oscillatory heat flux
The effects of radiation on unsteady MHD free convective flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting fluid past an oscillating vertical porous plate embedded in a porous medium with an oscillatory heat flux in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic filed have been studied. The governing equations describing the flow are solved analytically. It is observed that the fluid velocity is effected by the magnetic parameter. An increase in radiation parameter leads to decrease the fluid velocity near the plate and to increase away from the plate. The fluid velocity increases near the plate and it decreases away from the plate with an increase in suction parameter. The solution exists for both suction and blowing at the plate. The fluid velocity increases near the plate and it decreases away from the plate with an increase in Darcy number. It is seen that the fluid temperature decreases near the plate and it increases away from the plate with an increase in either radiation parameter or Prandtl number or suction parameter or frequency parameter. Further, it is seen that the amplitude of the shear strass and the tangent of the phase angle at the plate decreases with an increase in either radiation parameter or Prandtl number or suction parameter.
