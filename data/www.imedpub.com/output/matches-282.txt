Effect of Film Thickness on the Transmittance of Chemical Bath Fabricated CdS Thin Film
Effect of Film Thickness on the Transmittance of Chemical Bath Fabricated CdS Thin Film was investigated in this paper. The films of different thicknesses were deposited on to glass substrate. Structural and surface morphology of the films were carried out using an x-ray diffractometer with Cukα radiation and Olympus Optical microscope respectively. The films were found to have high transmittance (67.5 %) for the film with the lowest thickness of approximately t = 1.126μm (Cd2) and low transmittance (30%) for the film with highest film thickness of approximately t = 1.216. The material was confirmed to have cubic zinc blend structure.
