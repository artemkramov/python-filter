Determination of physico-chemical characteristics of four canals of Allahabad region and its suitability for irrigation
The present work was conducted by monitoring four canal water i.e. Ariyl canal, Ghoorpur canal, sharda Canal and Agriculture canal. The quality was assessed in terms of Physico-chemical parameters. Canal water samples were collected from four (4) various locations from January to April 2011. Attempts were made to study and analyze the Physico-chemical characteristics of the canal water various parameters such as Colour, pH, Temperature, Electrical conductance (EC), Total dissolved solid (TDS), Total alkalinity, Dissolved oxygen (DO), Chemical oxygen demand (COD)and Biological oxygen demand (BOD),were investigated to know the present status of the canal water quality of Allahabad .It was found that the water quality parameters were below the pollution level for canal water which satisfy the requirement for the use of irrigation in agriculture. The correlation between chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were found highly significant. The present investigation was carried out with determination of Physico-Chemical Characteristics of four Canals of Allahabad region and its Suitability for Irrigation purpose
