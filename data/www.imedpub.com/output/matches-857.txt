Effectiveness of an economic adsorbent in the adsorption of methylene blue from an industrial dyeing effluent
An low-cost and eco-friendly activated carbon from the fruits of Mimusops Elengi ( Makhizam Poo ) has been used in this study to remove methylene blue from an industrial dyeing effluent . The effect of variation of initial concentration of dye solution on the adsorption of dye from an industrial effluent, the optimum contact time for effective adsorption of dye has been studied and compared with that of commercially available activated carbon. The applicability of adsorption isotherms to study the adsorption behaviour has also been analyzed. An increase in the percentage removal of methylene blue from 35.7 to 63.3% with ACM in 180 minutes of agitation time was noted when the initial concentration of methylene blue obtained from a dyeing industrial effluent was varied from 1000 to 600mg/L. The favourable value of RL in the Langmuir adsorption data shows the feasibility of the adsorption process.
