Assessment of heavy metals concentrations in bore-hole waters in Aliero community of Kebbi State
Bore-hole water samples from three areas in Aliero, Metropolis of Kebbi state were analysed, using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS). The physicochemical values obtained were compared with the WHO permissible standards for drinking water. Some heavy metals determined were found to have levels above the WHO recommended value while others, such as Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn had values below the permissible unit. The level of the metals followed the order Cu (0.302 – 0.606mg/l) &gt; Pb (0.047 – 0.245mg/l) &gt; Cr (0.052 – 0.121mg/l) &gt; Ni (0.035 – 0.087mg/l) &gt; Co(0.03 – 0.07mg/l), except for the Fe value of K.S.U.S.T. which was estimated as 1.282mg/l. The implication of these high levels of such metals in man’s health were highlighted.
