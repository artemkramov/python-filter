Fracture zone detection using very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic method in parts of Oban Massif, southeastern Nigeria
Very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic method was conducted to study fracture zone detection in parts of Oban Massif, Southeastern Nigeria. A total of twelve (12) profiles were covered during VLF data collection with 5m sample interval along each profile with spread length of between 120 and 650m. The VLF data were collected using ABEM Wadi instrument. The data were interpreted using KHFFILT software. The results of the study showed the presence of fracture zones and are prominently oriented in the NE-SW and NW-SE direction. The results also showed that most of the fracture zones were located at a depth range of 0 to 60m within the subsurface. The presence of and interconnectivity of the fracture zones show that the study area has good prospects for groundwater. The study therefore recommends the drilling of productive and sustainable boreholes at locations VLF 01, VLF 03, VLF 06, VLF 08, VLF 10 and VLF 12 between 125-175m, 230-300m, 50-150m, 200-290m, 275-400m and 200-225m respectively along the profile.
