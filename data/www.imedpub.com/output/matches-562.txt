Uptake of mineral elements by Brassica juncea and its effects on biochemical parameters
Plant growth, uptake of mineral elements and biochemical parameters are determined for Brassica juncea. Mineral elements such as Cu, Zn, Mn, Mg, Na and P, protein content, amino acid content and chlorophyll content were estimated. 88.8 ± 0.2 mg/g is the highest protein content in shoot increased by Zn uptake and 0.94 ±0.02 mg/g is the high amino acid concentration in shoot achieved by Na uptake. Cu and Zn uptake gives no effect in total chlorophyll content. Mineral treated Brassica juncea plants showed enhanced uptake of Copper which would be an attractive property for use in phytoextraction, where plants are used to accumulate pollutants followed by harvesting of the plant material.
