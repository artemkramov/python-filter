The toxic effect of the pesticides on Apis mellifera intermissa (Hymenoptera, Apidae): Glutathione S-Transferase Activity
The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of pesticides used in orchards of Annaba region (North-East Algeria) on Apis mellifera intermissa, during the spring of 2011. The control site was represented by a region located in Sidi Kaci (Wilaye El Taref) forest while the second site was represented by an orchard fruits located in Ben Amar (Wilaye El Taref) which was treated with various pesticides. Traps were placed near and under the hives placed in fields in order to estimate the mortality of honey bees for each site. The results revealed a high mortality in treated site compared to the control site. The pesticide toxicity was confirmed by the GST measurement activity. The results showed a significant induction on specific activity of GST in local bees.
