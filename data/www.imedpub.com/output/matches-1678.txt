Removal of Cr (VI) from their aqueous solution by using brass industry waste (Slag) as an adsorbent
The adsorption efficiency of the brass industry slag for removal of heavy metal Cr from its aqueous solution was studied as slag consist of calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide etc. The research is a batch scale experimental type and analysis has performed by using different amount of adsorbent in solution with five different concentration of Cr metal. About 94% and 95% Cr removal achieved by using 1 and 1.5 g adsorbent for solution having concentration of 5 and 10 mg/L Cr. It was also found that adsorption efficiency depend on the amount of adsorbent as adsorption efficiency of Cr was increased from 70% to 100% in the same solution (5 mg/L).
