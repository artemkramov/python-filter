Coencapsulation of Synbiotics for the evaluation of in vivo antidiabetic activity
Glucose is the main source of energy for the body cells and different organisms possess different levels of glucose levels in their body. Change in levels of blood glucose leads to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. When the body fails to regulate blood glucose levels correctly and the levels go beyond the normal range, one becomes diabetic. Diabetes is a chronic disease and can even lead to death. Synbiotics; a combination of probiotics and prebiotics show beneficial health effects to the host and the effects vary with strain of probiotic and type of prebiotic used. The current study was performed to determine the hypoglycemic potential of the coencapsulated prebiotic (lactulose) and probiotic (Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei<a>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>cells/ml) in vivo. Encapsulation was done using Sodium Alginate (3.5%) &amp; Calcium Chloride (75mM), resulting in the formation of calcium alginate beads of synbiotics. Glibenclamide was taken as positive control. Alloxan (150 mg kg-1 b.wt. i.e. 50 mg kg-1 b.wt.) was used to induce diabetes in animals. Acute and subacute studies were conducted on alloxan induced diabetic mice. Results showed that encapsulated form of synbiotics were more efficient in lowering down the blood glucose levels as compared to unencapsulated form.
