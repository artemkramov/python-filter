Assessment of ground water contamination in soil due to leachate migration from an open dumping site of Dharapuram Municipality, Tamilnadu, India
The ground water pollution was studied in the soil samples collected around the municipal solid waste (MSW) open dumpsite, Dharapuram, Tirupur District, Tamilnadu to understand the heavy leachate migration from an open dumping site. The dump site receives approximately 33 to 40 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day. Ground water samples were collected in and around the solid waste dumping yard and analyzed for their physico- chemical characteristics to ascertain the extent of groundwater pollution through leachate migration. The data discussed in this study shows that sampling stations S4 and S5 were highly polluted due to the migration of leachate into ground water. Currently, the well and bore well were not used by the concern land owner. Indiscriminate dumping of municipal solid waste without proper solid waste management practices should be stopped or some remedial measures were required to be adopted to prevent contamination
