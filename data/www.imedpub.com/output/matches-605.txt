Geophysical Characterisation of Shallow Aquifers in a Sedimentary Area: A Case Study
A geophysical survey involving the Schlumberger vertical electrical sounding (VES) electrical resistivity was done in Ode Aye, a sedimentary area in, southwestern Nigeria with the aim of delineating and characterizing shallow aquifers in the area. In this study twenty-four VES stations were occupied along six traverses. The study delineated three distinct geologic units-the lateritic top soil/sand layer, the loose sand/sandstone layer, and the shale/sandy shale layer. The middle layer (loose sand/sand stone layer) was delineated as the aquifer unit which range in thickness between 7.5-32.1m. The aquifer unit was however characterized as prone to contamination due to the shallow nature of the overburden top layer. It was suggested that boreholes drilled in the area should be properly cased to enable the sieving of the recharge groundwater.
