The incidence of intestinal nematodes in primary school children in Ezza North Local Government Area, Ebonyi State Nigeria
The research was carried out to determine the incidence of intestinal nematode infection in primary school children in three primary schools in Ezza North Local Government Area, Ebonyi State. Eight hundred feacal samples were examined using direct smear method. Out of the number examined, 204 (25.5%,), comprising 395 males (27.6%) and 405 (23.5%) females were infected with intestinal nematodes of Ascaris lumbricoides (20.0%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.4%) Hookworm (3.5%) and Trichuris trichuria (1.3%).Sex was found to be a strong factor influencing the prevalence. Statistical analysis indicates a significance difference (p&lt;0.05) between parasites with Ascaris lumbricoides having the highest prevalence of infection. Therefore, regular deworming exercise with albendazole, a product of antihelminthes will improve the health status of the children while early diagnosis, personal hygiene and health campaign programme if carried out in rural areas will impact the knowledge of good hygiene on people.
