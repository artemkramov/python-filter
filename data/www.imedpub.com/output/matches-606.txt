Integrated Geophysical Investigation and Characterisation of Aquifer Structures in a Complex Environment
An integrated geophysical investigation was executed in Igarra, Nigeria with a view to characterising the possible aquifer structure and units in the area. The Ground Magnetic, Very Low-Frequency Electromagnetic and Electrical Resistivity methods were employed in this study along three traverses with length varying between 180 – 250 m. The presence of a geologic structure which is most probably a fractured zone was established. The aquifer unit in the area was characterised as being susceptible to contamination due to the general thickness of its Overburden cover.
