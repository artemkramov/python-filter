Studies on avifauna in and around Melaselvanoor and Keelaselvanoor bird sanctuary Ramanathapuram district, Tamilnadu
The present study was carried out in Melaselvanoor and Keelaselvanoor Bird Sanctuary (KMBS) during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 and was observed 116 species from the KMBS, Ramanathapuram which shows that this sanctuary supports a high diversity of birds. Most of the observed species are mixed forest residents mainly due to occurrence of various types of microhabitat within the sanctuary, nearby ocean and a large pond. Due to the abundance of endemic species this Sanctuary is very important for bird conservation in this part of the world. The Gulf of Mannar which is a famous tourist spot is located in the vicinity of the Melaselvanoor and Keelaselvanoor Bird sanctuary (KMBS) increasing tourist activity especially during the months of December and January is now becoming a serious threat to the birds of this sanctuary. Cattle grazing and use of forest wood as a source of fuel by local people are also creating adverse conditions for the birds of the region
