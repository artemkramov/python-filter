Optical absorption spectra of rare earth elements with amino acid in different solvents
The optical absorption spectra of complex of Neodymium and Praseodymium with amino acid Histidine as primary ligand and propane 1,3- diol as secondary ligand have been recorded in visible region (360-900 nm) in ratio (1:2:1) in water. Methanol, Ethanol and Acetic Acid . The energies and intensities of various transitions were calculated using Judd-Ofelt relation and are in good agreement with what we have obtained experimentally.
