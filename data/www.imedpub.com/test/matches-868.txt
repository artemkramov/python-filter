Emission Spectrum of Crude Oil flames at Dikom
On September 15, 2005 a huge flame of fire occurred at Dikom (94.6E, 27.3N) as a result of sudden and accidental out burst of oil-well of Oil India Limited. The incident is first of its kind during last five decades. The height of the flame about 100m and it covered an approximate area of 900m2 and the temperature measured at a distance of 100 meter from the flame was 45oC. Experts from abroad had to be brought to quench the fire and during the time of writing this communication the flame is still in the process of burning and has created sufficient environmental problem. In the present work we report the results of spectroscopic investigation carried out with the help of a miniaturized fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean Optics Inc USA) coupled with a Laptop (Model Travel Mate 2355NXC, Acer). The emission spectrum exhibits a symmetric distribution of intensity profile in the range of wavelength of 4500Å to 9000Å. The prominent lines recorded in the spectrum are at 5893Å, which is presumably originating from sodium atom. The other lines are observed at 7855Å, 7714Å, 7607Å, 7446Å, 7357Å, 7253Å, 7080Å, 7000Å, 6821Å, 6749Å, 6643Å, 6428Å and 5893Å. The higher wavelengths represent the band heads of a diatomic radical. Visual observations with the help of a pocket spectroscope also indicate the presents of atomic lines and ionized lines. The present study analysis the spectroscopic information on a crude oil flame via the use of the persistent lines in the emission spectrum.
