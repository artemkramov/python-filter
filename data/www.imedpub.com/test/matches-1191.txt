Phytochemical compositions of some extracts used in alternative medicine in Nigeria
Natural products provide many fine chemical and biochemical extracts that have medicinal values. Phytochemicals are non-nutritive plant chemicals but they are bioactive compounds found in plants that work with nutrients and dietary fibre to protect against diseases. They inhibit the growth of cancer cells, improve immune function, block carcinogens, and help clear out toxins or other damaging substances, among other actions. The aim of the study was the comparison analysis of the phytochemical compositions of some extracts used in alternative medicine. The analyses were carried out on four extracts-the extracts from earthworm, Aloe vera, Ganoderma lucidium, and snail (Archachatina) using standard methods. The means and standard error of means (SEM) were determined using SPSS version 20.The results showed that phytochemicals were majorly present in Aloe vera and Ganoderma extracts and there significant differences (P&lt; 0.05) in the values of most of the phytochemicals between Aloe vera extract and Ganoderma extracts. The present study of the phytochemical constituents in Aloe vera extract, Ganoderma extract gives credence to their usefulness by traditional herbalists in ethno medicine.
