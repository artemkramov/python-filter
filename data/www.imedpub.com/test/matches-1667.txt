A protocol for rapid propagation of genetically true to type Indian turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) through in vitro culture technique
As the plant Curcuma longa L. is an ethnomedicinally important one and almost all the parts of the plant are reported to contain curcumin and its structural analogues. Rhizomatous explants from two months old buds were cultured on Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of cytokinins and auxins. During the first culture on 2.5 mg/l of 6-benzylamino purine (BAP) and 1.5 mg/l of α Napthalenic acetic acid (NAA) yeilds 9.00±0.57a number of shoots with an average shoot length of 7.20±1.01a cm. The elongated shoots produced 9.66±1.20a roots on half strength MS liquid medium supplemented with 2 mg/l of Indole 3 butyric acid (IBA) and showed 86 % survivability after hardening. Genetic fidelity of the micropropagated plantlets was confirmed using RAPD analysis employing 12 primers. This system provides high fidelity micropropagation system for efficient and rapid micropropagation of this important medicinal plant
