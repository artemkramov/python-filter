Diversity of fish fauna in lower Manair reservoir of Karimnagar district (A.P.), India
Diversity of fish fauna in the Lower Manair reservoir was studied from September-2010 to August-2011. Samples were collected monthly with help of local fishermen by using fishing nets. A total of 44 species of fishes belonging to 8 orders such as Cypriniformes (18 species) Siluriformes (11species), Perciformes (6 species), Channiformes (4 species) Beloniformes(2 species), Angulliformes (one species) Osteoglossiformes (one species) and Mogiliformes(one species). Of these, 24 species of fish are least concerned, 8 are data deficient (DD), 10 are not evaluate (NE), 1 species of fish is vulnerable and 1 species of fish is near threatened.
