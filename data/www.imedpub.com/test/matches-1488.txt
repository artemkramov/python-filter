Unsteady MHD flow of a viscous fluid past a vertical porous plate under oscillatory suction velocity
The study of hydromagnetic unsteady MHD flow of an incompressible, electrically conducting, viscous fluid past an infinite vertical porous plate along with porous medium of time dependent permeability under oscillatory suction velocity normal to the plate has been made. It is considered that the influence of the uniform magnetic field acts normal to the flow and the permeability of the porous medium fluctuate with the time. The problem is solved, numerically by Galerkin finite element method for velocity, temperature, concentration; skin-friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are also obtained. The results obtained are discussed for Grash of number (Gr &gt;0)corresponding to the cooling of the plate and (Gr &lt;0)corresponding to the heating of the plate with the help of graphs and tables to observe the effects of various parameters.
