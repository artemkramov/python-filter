Acoustical studies on molecular interactions in binary liquid mixtures at 303K
The acoustical parameters for three binary liquid mixtures namely Acrylonitrile + methanol, Acrylonitrile + cyclohexane and Acrylonitrile +1, 4–dioxane have been measured. From the measured data, some of the acoustical parameters such as adiabatic compressibility (βa) , free length (Lf), free volume (Vf), internal pressure (πi), relaxation time (τ) , acoustic impedance(Za) and Gibb’s free energy(ΔG)values are computed for the three systems at 303K, from the measures values of ultrasonic velocity(U),density(ρ) and viscosity(η). The behavior of these parameters with composition of the mixture has been discussed in terms of molecular interaction between the components of liquids.
