The purpose of the geophysical survey was to investigate the subsurface geologic parameters of the aquifer layers. ABEM 1000C Terrameter with an inbuilt booster was used for the study. Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) in eighty selected locations were sounded with the Schlumberger array. The geo-location data of VES sites were obtained with the GPS map 76csx. The maximum current electrodes spacing was 1,362 m, except in VES 13, (510 m), VES 14, (430 m) and VES 17, (928 m). The investigation showed that the study area is made of 5-8 earth layers with various thicknesses, (13.7 m-181.6 m), depths, (38.9 m-198.6 m) and resistivities, (115 Ωm-18,111.8 Ωm) respectively. The curves were of the types; HAAKQ, AAK, AAAK, AKQH, KQQH, AAKH, AKQ, AKQQ, AAKQ, HAKQH, AAKQH and HKHAKQ. Most of the curves have the ascending A-type, an indication of a horizontally stratified homogenous earth.
