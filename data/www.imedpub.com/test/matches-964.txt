Measurement of background gamma radiation levels at the main campus of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University Lapai, Niger State, Nigeria
An in-situ measurement of the background radiation level was carried out on the main campus of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria. Geiger-Mueller tube-based environmental radiation dosimeter was used for the measurement. A total of 15 point was surveyed across the campus for background environmental radiation. The dose rate obtained ranged from 0.112μSv/hr to 0.210 μSv/hr. The mean dose rate was 0.158μSv/hr with standard deviation of 0.029μSv/hr. Generally, the dose rate level from different parts of the institution are comparable to one another and could simply be attributed to natural sources. The average annual effective dose obtained from this study is 0.258mSv/annum, which is less than the recommended limit of 1mSv/annum by International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) for non-occupational population exposure.
