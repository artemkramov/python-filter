Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological activity of 3-(pyridin-4-yl)- [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole derivativ
A novel series of heterocyclic compounds N-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)-2-(3-(pyridin-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4- b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)benzamide derivatives 5a–j have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-amino-5-(pyridin-4- yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol 3 and 2-((4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)carbamoyl)benzoic acid derivatives 4a–j. Synthesized heterocyclic compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT–IR and LC-MS spectral studies. Antibacterial activities of all the compounds were studied against gram positive and gram negative bacteria and antifungal activities of all the compounds were studied against various fungi.
