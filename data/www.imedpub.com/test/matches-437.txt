Suitability of stuffed and cooked cutlet blend was evaluated for the preparation of battered and breaded products. Minced meat was prepared from the reef cod biochemical and microbiological and sensory analyses are carried out for fried cutlet. Based on the sensory score and biochemical values cutlet blend mixed with meat was found to be suitable. In the present study the reed cod fish (Epinephelus diacanthus) was used for the preparation of fish cutlet.
