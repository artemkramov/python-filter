Research of vertical wells multilayer fracturing transformation technology
The difficulties in oil mining is increasing and the quality of the remaining oil reduced gradually after Daqing oil field came into the late high water contamination stage. There are several factors that prevent the convention from single layer fracturing technology to multilayer fracturing technology. Firstly, about 20% of fracturing rate could be achieved by elevating the K Series packer 3 times in the 5 fracturing techniques, but the performance of the plastic tube cannot be guaranteed. Secondly, the fracturing success rate is not guaranteed if Y series are elevated 4 times to complete the 5 layer fracturing, besides consistent intervals between the five layers must be maintained, which is very difficult. To further enhance the vertical well fracturing multilayer capability, we carry out multi-layered vertical well fracturing technology research, and have achieved good results in the field application
