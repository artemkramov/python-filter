Augmenting efficacy of the commercial probiotic consortium, EcotraxÃÂ® on soil, water quality, survival, growth and feed transformation on the semi-intensive pond culture system of the white leg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931)
The competence of the commercial probiotic consortium, Ecotrax® as water and soil probiotic in enhancing the water quality, growth, survival and feed conversion of Litopenaeus vannamei were investigated for better yield with lesser feed conversion ratio (FCR). Three test ponds treated with Ecotrax® and three control ponds were used in the study for the duration of 119 days. Weekly investigation at regular intervals were conducted on both experimental groups for physicochemical parameters of water involving temperature, pH, salinity, transparency, dissolved oxygen (DO), hardness, and average body weight (ABW) to favour proper feed management and pond management strategies. Total production, survival numbers, survival percentage, ABW, feed conceded and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were analysed post harvesting in both test and control ponds. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.001) were observed in the parameters like transparency and hardness between the test and control ponds. Water quality was observed to be nutritive in the test ponds treated with Ecotrax®. This was also proven by the productivity with significant difference (P &lt; 0.001) between the experimental groups. Test ponds treated with Ecotrax® had exhibited higher production, survival percentage, ABW, feed consumption with attractively lesser FCR. Ecotrax® (TIL Biosciences) was highly effective in maintaining the soil and water quality parameters, engendering better growth, survival, ABW, yield and impressive FCR in L. vannamei shrimp aquaculture. Thus generating higher revenue to the aquaculturists and contributing to the economic growth of the country.
