Studies on the Effect of Cyanobacteria on Tobacco Pasted Albino Rat (Rattus norvegicus)
The albino rat treated with tobacco decreases body weight than the control rat fed with normal diet then treated with Synechocysis pevalekii showed increased body weight the control as well as the tobacco pasted rat. Regarding enzyme status, alkaline phosphate and acid phosphatase enzyme showed very good promise in the experimental rat treated with Cyanobacteria diet. The heamatological study carried on the blood control, tobacco pasted and cyanoabacteria treated rat, display no remarkable change except for slight rise in WBC, RBC, platelet, albumin, glucose, protein and haemoglobin. The present investigation confirmed that marine blue green algae can easily be digested and assimilated and therefore can serve as a source of diet for an albino rat and good remedy for affected tissues.
