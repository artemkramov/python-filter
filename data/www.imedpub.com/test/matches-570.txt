Effect of the plug flow on the flow characteristics of bile through diseased cystic duct: Casson Model Analysis
Bile flow in the human biliary system plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of biliary diseases. In the present study, the effect of the plug flow in the cystic duct on the flow characteristics of bile is observed. Bile is taken as a Casson fluid. The expression for the flow characteristics like the resistance and the wall shear stress is studied. It is observed that as the size of stone and the core radius increases, the resistance to flow and the shear stress also increases.
