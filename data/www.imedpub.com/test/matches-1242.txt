Geochemical investigation of groundwater in Veppanthattai block of Perambalur, Tamilnadu, India
Perambalur is the backward administrative district in the state of Tamilnadu India. It has 4 blocks namely Alathur, Perambalur, Veppanthattai and Veppur. Among these Veppanthattai block has the historical importance and is blessed with good agricultural land. The people used the groundwater mostly for drinking and agricultural purposes. Groundwater samples from bore wells were collected from various areas in the Veppanthattai block in Perambalur district during monsoon season and were analyzed for their physical-chemical characteristics. The present study was undertaken to characterize the physico-chemical parameters such as pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Total Hardness (TH), Total Alkalinity (TA), Calcium, Magnesium, Chloride, Sulphate, Nitrate, Iron, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Phosphate. Each parameter was compared with the standard permissible limit of the parameter as prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO, 2005) and suitable suggestions were reported
