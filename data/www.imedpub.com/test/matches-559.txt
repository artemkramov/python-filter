Dioxin-Like Polychlorinated Biphenyls in River Sediments
Dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) was investigated in sediments from Yamuna River in Delhi, India. The concentration of Σdl-PCBs ranges between 0.04-5.59 with an average of 1.28±0.16 ng g-1. Among the 12 dl- PCB congeners the congener no PCB-118 and PCB-114 were the dominant congeners and accounted for &gt;48% and &gt;24%, respectively. Toxic equivalency in term of toxic equivalent quotient (TEQ) of Σdl-PCBs was calculated and presented. The TEQ in this study was ranged between &lt;0.01-115.23 pg WHO2005-TEQ g-1 with an average of 14.42±2.20 pg WHO2005-TEQ g-1. CB-126 and CB-169 congeners represent the higher TEQ values which both had the high toxic potency. Concentration of dl-PCBs does not exceed sediment quality guidelines.
