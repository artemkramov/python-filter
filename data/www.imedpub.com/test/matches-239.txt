Physico-chemical and microbiological assessment of borehole water in Okutukutu, Bayelsa State, Nigeria
The concern over exposure to drinking water contaminants and the resultant adverse effect on human health has prompted several studies evaluating the quality of drinking water sources. Treated water samples were collected from all twenty one (21) functional boreholes in Okutukutu using standard techniques. PH, Turbidity, Iron, Nitrate, Chlorine, Calcium, Magnesium and E. coli, in the water samples were determined using standard procedures. One household for each borehole by simple random method was selected and stored water from the borehole was bacteriologically assessed. World Health Organisation acceptable limits for drinking water were used in the evaluation. All physico-chemical parameters in borehole water samples were within recommended standards. Residual chlorine at the sample tap was less than recommended amount of 0.2mg/l in 61.9% of the boreholes. All borehole samples tested negative for E. coli. 66.7% of stored borehole samples in household tested positive for E. coli but was negative for all other enterococci bacteria.This study has shown that water from the boreholes in Okutukutu community in Yenagoa Local Government Area in Bayelsa state, (judging from the physico – chemical and microbiological variables measured in this study) is safe for drinking and other uses. The microbiological analysis of stored borehole water showed that 14(66.7%) of stored house hold water was contaminated with E.coli. Hence there is need for improved hygiene and regular hygiene education.
