Studies on Isolation and Identification of VAM Fungi in Solanum viarum Dunal of Medicinal Plants
Medicinal plants are nature’s gift to cure a number of diseases of living organisms. The plant Solanum viarum is the potential renewable natural resources. The plant is cultivated under the agro climate soil conditions and the field of biotechnology as most of the pharmaceutical industries depends Largely on the utilization of plants for the production of compounds to study the variability in natural infection rates, spore density and species richness of AM fungi associated with and medicinal plant Solanum viarum which was culture from herbal garden at poondi, Thanjavur. The efficient of AM fungi and their mass production of Sorghum bicolor roots by pot culturing techniques were assessed. The physico chemical characteristics of the soil at the study site were, analysed. The observation recorded on the influnce on growth are also described.
