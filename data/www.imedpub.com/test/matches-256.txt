Decolourisation of Textile Dyes and Biological stains by Bacterial strains isolated from Industrial effluents
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Brevibacillus choshinensis were enriched and isolated from effluent sample of a textile processing unit using Sterile Minimal medium containing 10% Glucose and incubated at 28 ± 2° C for 7 days. The isolates were identified using standard biochemical tests carried out by KEM Hospital, Pune, India. These isolates were checked for decolourisation of textile dyes and biological stain solutions. It was found that both the bacterial isolates were able to degrade the textile dyes upto 250 ppm concentration. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was further studied for decolourisation of biological stain solutions and was found to decolorize upto 100 ppm of the stain solution. Phytotoxicity of the textile dyes was estimated by measuring the relative changes in seed germination of three plants: Triticum spp. (Wheat), Vigna radiate (Moong seeds) and Brassica juncea (Mustards seeds). Radicle and Plumule growth (length) were recorded after 6 days of exposure to different concentrations of dyes. Toxicity of the degraded dye was also checked which indicated that after decolourization the toxicity of the dye reduced. This property of these bacterial isolates shows a potential that can be utilized for the bioremediation of various textile industrial effluents thus saving the ecosystem from harmful effects of various dyes.
