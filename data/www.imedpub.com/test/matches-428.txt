Standardization of auxin concentration for root induction in Chrysanthemum morifolium
Chrysanthemum morifoIium is a vegetative propagated perennial ornamental plant. The Root initiation medium comprised of different concentrations in various combinations. The best initiation with well differentiated micro shoots was achieved when the cultures were transferred to MS medium fortified with the various concentrations of auxins. Out of the different treatments tried 0.5 mg/l NAA induced maximum rooting (88.66%), followed by control 79.00%) as compared to 1.0 mg/l NAA (76.66).
