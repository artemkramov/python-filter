A study of BloembergenÃ¢ÂÂs three level maser and phenomenon of inhibition of transition between quantum states by frequent measurements
The Quantum Zeno effect is the phenomenon of inhibition of transition between quantum states by frequent measurements. The term Quantum Zeno effect (QZE) was originally introduced by E.C.G.Sudarshan and it may be applied to explain various transitions. In the present work we discuss the essential features of Bloembergen’s three level maser and its connection with Quantum Zeno effect
