Use of water quality index to validate lentic ecosystem pollution and seasonal dissimilarity at Channarayapatna taluk, Hassan district, Karnataka, India
To evaluate spatial and temporal contamination of selected water bodies using Water Quality Index (WQI) has been calculated for Channarayapatna (SC1 and SC2), Bagur (SB1 and SB2), Janivara (SJ1 and SJ2) and Anekere (SA1 and SA2) at Channarayapatna taluk during pre-monsoon season and monsoon season. Water quality parameters were selected as per the WHO guidelines. Fourteen water quality physico-chemical parameters were estimated as per the standard methods and procedures. Drinking water at almost all the sites was found to be highly contaminated, except a few sites, where it was found moderately contaminated for both the seasons during the year 2011. In general, to some extent water quality showed deterioration after the onset of monsoon. The rural village activity produces a serious and negative effect on the water quality, this is due sewage discharge from the villages. It was found that some effective measures are urgently required for water quality management in this region.
