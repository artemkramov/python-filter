Ascorbic Acid, Lycopene and Antioxidant Activities of Red-fleshed and Yellow-fleshed Watermelons
Ascorbic acid, lycopene and antioxidant activities of two varieties of seeded watermelon, red-fleshed and yellowfleshed watermelon were analyzed in this study. The flesh of red-fleshed watermelon had higher ascorbic acid (86.32 mg/kg) and lycopene (9.50 mg/kg) contents compared to the ascorbic acid (52.05 mg/kg) and lycopene (0.04 mg/kg) contents of the flesh of yellow-fleshed watermelon. The whole fruit of red-fleshed watermelon had lycopene content of 2.60 mg/kg which was higher than that of whole fruit of yellow-fleshed watermelon (0.37 mg/kg) but, both had similar ascorbic acid contents. The anti-radical power and ferrous ion chelating activity values ranged from 0.0062-0.0090 and 2.94-27.90%, respectively
