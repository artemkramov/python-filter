Haematological alteration in European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus (Linn.) exposed to ethereal
Different hematological parameters and its indices were evaluated in the study. After exposure hemoglobin (Hb), total RBC, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Packed Cell Volume (PCV), Mean Corpuscle Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), Mean Carpuscle Volume (MCH) and platelets values exhibited significantly decreased whereas increased in total WBC count, Reticulocytes, Mean Carpuscle Haemoglobin (MCV), neutrophils (N) and lymphocytes (L) were recorded. While eosinophils (E), monocytes (M) and basophiles (B) were not elevated or depleted. The present study indicated the toxic effect of ethephon on hematological parameters of rabbit
