Crystallization, FT-IR and powder XRD study of gel grown iron-manganesenickel ternary dextro-tartrate crystals in hydro silica gel
In the present investigation, iron-manganese-nickel ternary dextro-tartrate crystals have been grown by single diffusion reaction gel growth technique in hydro silica gel.Crystals having green colourand spheruliticmorphology were grown within the gel column. The grown crystals were subjected to powder X-ray diffraction technique to study cell parameters and crystalline nature of iron-manganese-nickel ternary dextro-tartrate crystals. FTIR spectroscopic analysis was performed to identify the presence of various functional groups in the iron-manganesenickel ternary dextro-tartrate crystals
