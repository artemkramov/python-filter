Phytochemical screening and inhibitory effect of n-butanol, isopropanol and water extracts leaf extracts of Sapindus saponaria Vahl on selected pathogens
The preliminary phytochemical screening of the leaves with n-Butanol, isopropanol and water extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, steroids, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenes and phenols. In vitro antimicrobial studies of these leaf extracts were carried out on four medically important microbial strains, including Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus peritolis which were procured from the Microbial Type Culture and Collection, Chandigarh, India, using agar disc diffusion method. The microbial strains were exposed to the following four different concentrations of extracts: 50mg/ml, 100mg/ml, 200mg/ml and 300mg/ml solvent. The results of our antimicrobial assay revealed that the extract showed good inhibitory activity against all the tested pathogens compared with standard antibiotic like streptomycin. The inhibitory activities were found to be dose dependent
