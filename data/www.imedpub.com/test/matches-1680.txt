In vitro rooting of different species of banana
Plant tissue culture is the technique of growing plant cells, tissues, and organs in an artificial prepared nutrient medium. The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of different concentrations of growth regulators on rooting in different species of Banana such as Ardhapuri, Basrai, Shrimanti. The shoots which are developed on MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium was inoculated on same medium supplemented with combinations of growth regulators BAP (1, 3, 5, 7, 9mg/l) with IAA and IBA (1, 2, 3mg/l). With regard to different treatments the best rooting response was observed in BAP 1 mg/l +IBA 3mg/l.
