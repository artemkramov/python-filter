Decolorization of structurally dissimilar dyes by a termite derived bacterial consortium BUTC17 in a cost effective nutrient medium
The present study aimed at isolating bacterial strains from termites and to check their efficiency as individual strains and as a consortium in decolorizing 14 structurally different dyes at static and shaking conditions. Twelve morphologically different colonies were identified during the initial phase of this experiment which are further subjected for their dye decolorizing capability. Initial screening established that decolorization of dyes resulted better when individual strains in static incubation (79.5%) condition was applied. But further experiments on employing various consortia made clear that consortia comprising 4 individual isolates displayed a better decolorization efficiency of Reactive blue 220 which was calculated to be about 94.3% When various media was used to make out a cost effective media for decolorization, it was observed that decolorizing medium in static condition favored better decolorization of 95.3% and 94.4% of Reactive blue 220 and Reactive red 195 and growth of the consortium was also well supported under this condition. The overall results suggested that these bacterial strains as a consortium holds a great novelty and will render a higher performance of decolorization in a economical nutrient medium which in turn has a huge application when applied in a large scale.
