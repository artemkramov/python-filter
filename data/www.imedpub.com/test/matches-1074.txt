Mixed symmetry states in platinum isotopes by using the proton and neutron interacting boson model(IBM-2)
In this study the mixed symmetry states (MSS) in even mass Pt isotopes with mass interval 168 ≤ A ≤ 200 have been suggested within the framework of the Proton and Neutron Interacting Boson Model (IBM-2). The model calculations predicted a satisfactory fit to the experimental energy levels. It is found that, the energy of states (23, 24,25, 31 and 11) were responded rapidly to the variation of Majorana parameters in some isotopes, which indicates the initial property of the mixed symmetry state (MSS). The rest of MSS properties have been applied to those states, B(M1) values and B(M1)/B(E2) ratio, to support those results
