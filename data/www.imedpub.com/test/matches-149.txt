Biochemical esimation of wildly collected Ganoderma lucidudm from Central Himalayan Hills of India
This study was undertaken to reveal the amount of various bio-molecules present in Ganoderma lucidum by utilising various standard chemical methods. These bio-molecules are very important for vital organs of human body for their proper functioning. All together ten biochemical parameters were estimated which include total carbohydrates, simple carbohydrates, polysaccharides, reducing and non- reducing sugars, proteins, ether extract, fibres, organic matter and ash content. Wild collected sample of G. lucidum from Central Himalayan Hills was found to contain a perceptible amount of bioactive molecules predominantly polysaccharides (29.25 ± 1.38%), protein (20.61 ± 1.04%) and fibres (34.46 ± 1.78%) which are responsible for its number of therapeutic activities.
