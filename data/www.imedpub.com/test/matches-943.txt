Influence of nano solid lubricant emulsions on surface roughness of mild steel when machining on lathe machine
Now a day’s turning process is a widely used metal removal process in manufacturing industry that involves generation of high cutting forces and temperature. Lubrication becomes critical to minimize the effect of these forces and temperature on cutting tool and work piece. For this specific study investigation carried out to increase the surface finish of the work piece machined on lathe with addition of nano particles were synthesized by solution combustion process and size was found to be 28 nm from X-Ray Diffraction [XRD]. A thin layer of Al2O3 nano particles on steel can be obtained by various means i.e., liquid and solid process of particle deposition under various machining process. While turning of mild steel rod, three parameters are varied i.e., spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut. During machining Al2O3 nano particles are sprayed over it. This will lead to form a thin layer over the surface that will change in properties like surface roughness and hardness. Observed better surface roughness for coated material compared to that of base material. Coating thickness also observed at various conditions during machining process
