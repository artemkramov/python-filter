Stability analysis of a prey-predator model with a reserved area
The study presented here generalizes a model given by B. Dubey in which he proposed and analyzed a non-linear mathematical model to study the dynamics of fishery resource having two zones. In this paper, we have considered a prey-predator fishery model with prey dispersal in a two-patch environment, one is assumed to be a free fishing zone and the other is a reserved zone, where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited. The local and global stability analysis has been carried out. Biological equilibria of the system along with the conditions of their existence are obtained. Criteria for the coexistence of predator-prey are obtained. Numerical simulation has also been performed in support of analysis.
