Efficacy of lichen extracts as biocontrol agents against Fusarium oxysporum F. Sp. Capsici
In vitro antifungal activity of ten lichens was evaluated against phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum using Agar well diffusion, Microdilution assay and Direct Bioautographic technique. Methanol, Ethyl acetate and Acetone extracts were used to determine antifungal properties of lichens. Highest yield was obtained from Flavoparmelia caperata with 1330 mg/ml from methanol. Well diffusion assay showed maximum inhibition with 21.3±1.5 mm in the methanol extract of Parmotrema austrosinensis. The MIC of the all tested extracts ranged from 0.097 – 6.25 mg/ml. The lowest concentration of 0.097 mg/ml was inhibited in the methanolic extract of Flavoparmelia caperata. The TLC bioautographic method showed zone of inhibition with 3 spots at an Rf value of 0.38, 0.64, 0.96 and 0.2, 0.41, 0.62 in Ethyl acetate extracts of Parmotrema austrosinensis and Parmotrema grayanum respectively. Sticta sp. and Parmotrema reticulatum did not show any activities
