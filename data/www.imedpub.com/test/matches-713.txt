Recovery of coagulants from water works sludge: A review
The management of the ever increasing residual sludge from our waterworks in an economical and environmentally friendly manner remains a very important issue. This has led to genuine efforts aimed at its beneficial re-use. The recovery of coagulants from water works sludge have been studied for several years, because of the toxic nature of free and complexed aluminum species to aquatic life, cost benefit of the recovery and the stringent environmental regulations on disposal of these sludge on land or into water bodies. This paper presents a review of the available reports of the researches on the various methods of recovery of coagulant from water works sludge.
