Quantification of human immunodeficiency virus using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) compared to ELISA in early diagnosis of infection
In the era of modern medicine, owing to an increasing incidence of HIV infection, many indirect tests including ELISA are readily available for the detection of HIV infection. However, they are not useful in early diagnosis of HIV infection. As early diagnosis is vital to treat HIV infection promptly, direct test like PCR is used for the earlier diagnosis and treatment of the infection. As a result, in the current study, we compared the efficacy of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with the Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera collected from HIV patients were analyzed using the qPCR, which detect the targeted gene of HIV and the results were compared with ELISA test, which reacted with antibodies against HIV antigens in the same sera
