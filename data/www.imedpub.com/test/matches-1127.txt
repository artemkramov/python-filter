Induced Breeding of Carps for Seed Production in Frp Hatchery
Portable Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) carp hatchery consisting of one spawning pool, two incubation pools, one egg/spawn collection tank and one overhead tank of capacity 1500 L was established and operated at Amarpur Village under Potaspur Block, West Bengal. In the monsoon of 2016, induced breeding of Indian major carps (Labeo rohita and Catla catla) and Indian minor carp (Labeo bata) was conducted for 4 times in the established hatchery. Induced breeding of these fishes was done successfully using synthetic hormone “Ovatide”. Total 20.5 lakh spawn was harvested, viz., Catla catla 10.0 lakh, Labeo rohita 8.0 lakh and Labeo bata 2.5 lakh. Under the optimum temperature range of 29-32ºC, spawning was observed after a latency period of 5-6 h. The fertilization rate was recorded 88-96% and the hatching success was 89-94%. Highest fertilization rate (96%) was recorded in catla followed by Labeo rohita (93%) and Labeo bata (89-91%). Time needed for completion of egg hatching was almost similar among the experimented fishes, i.e., Catla catla (940 minutes), Labeo rohita (920 minutes) and Labeo bata (895-945 min). Spawn production was 0.91 lakh/kg female body weight for catla, 0.94 lakh/kg for rohu and 0.775 lakh/kg (average) for Labeo bata.
