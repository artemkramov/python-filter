Rejuvenation of aquaculture farms after Tsunami and safe culture practice in Nagapattinam Coast
The present study is to find the effect of tsunami on coastal aquaculture ponds and the how this has further detrioriated the existing adverse environment, selecting sample ponds along the tsunami affected Nagapattinam coast. In particulalar, the Nagapattinam coast has been a reference of Supreme court judgement that no further aquaculture ponds need to be set up and the to monitor the environmental degradation of the exisiting ponds due to high contaminant levels of pollutants over water and soil.
