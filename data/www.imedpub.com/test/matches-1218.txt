Nature of gum polysaccharide extracted from Moringa oleifera Lam. (Sainjna) plant
Water soluble polysaccharide have been extracted from Moringa oleifera Lam. gum mucilage as L-arabinose and D-galactose in the molar ratio of 1:4 with traces of L-fucose. Hydrolysed gum polysaccharides were separated by paper chromatography and identified by column chromatography. It consumed 8.2 moles of iodine by iodometrically after 110 hrs. Nature of α and β-type linkages were confirmed by IR-Spectra (KBr). Sugars were identified by their specific rotations, melting points and preparation of their suitable crystalline derivatives.
