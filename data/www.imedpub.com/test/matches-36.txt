They agreed that they relied heavily on Nigerian Bottling Company for their income. Dealers who had served the Nigerian Bottling Company Plc for longer time were not given much preference by the Company while its mode of passing information to the dealers was faulted. Information through salesmen, market developers, and depot officers to dealers had not given the dealers the opportunity to the right, current and up to date information.
