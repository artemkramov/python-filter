Considerations for good performance in deep anode beds
This paper is a discussion of the necessary geological factors which need to be investigated to ensure good performance in deep anode ground beds. The key to good performance is the resistivity of strata over the length of the anode column. The proper selection of the correct geologic strata within which to place deep anode beds is crucial to the overall performance, not only initially, but over the operating life, and can substantially affect the overall cost of the system. Proper strata selection requires a composite analysis of all available factors such as geologic data, measured or calculated resistivities with borehole control in the form of lithologic logs, and electrical (resistivity) logs to enhance the chances for success
