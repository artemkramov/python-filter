Thermosperic wind response to geomagnetic activity in the low latitudes during the 2004 Equinox seasons
Thermospheric cross-track wind speeds deduced from STAR accelerometer aboard the CHAMP Satellite are used to study wind speed response to geomagnetic activity in the low latitudes during the 2004 March and September equinox seasons. The geomagnetic effect was not distinct for the two levels considered. Maximum speeds going above 250m/s were observed at the two levels considered. Our CHAMP observed wind turned eastwards from 20.00 to 23.00SLT and westwards from 07.00 to 09.00SLT instead of 17.00-19.00SLT and 05.00-08.00SLT respectively, as predicted by previous observations. Our study presented is focused on global scale variations in the thermospheric cross-track wind speeds between 7.50N and 10.50N geographic latitudes. Use of many satellites for simultaneous measurements at several points in space is suggested.
