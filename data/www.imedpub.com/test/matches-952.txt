Synthesis, characterization of some transition metal complexes of bidentate Schiff base and their antifungal and antimicrobial studies
A new series of Cu(II), Ni(II),and Co(II) complexes with bidentate Schiff base ligand derived from 2-amino 4,6 dihydroxypyrimidine and P- chlorobenzaldehyde have been reported. The complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility measurements, conductrometry, electronic and infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, 1H-NMR spectra and therogravimetric analysis. The ligand and its complexes were screened for their antifungal and antibacterial activity against Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Fusarium moneliforme and Aspergllus flavus .and Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis. The result indicated that the complexes exhibited good antifungal and antibacterial activities
