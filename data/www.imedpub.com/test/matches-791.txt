Solvent free synthesis of some chalcones and their effect on Bovine Serum Albumin
Substituted 1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ones were synthesized via solvent free synthesis and their effect on bovine serum albumin was evaluated. It was observed that the synthesized chalcones interacted with the serum protein irrespective of the type and position of the substituent and resulted in its precipitation.
