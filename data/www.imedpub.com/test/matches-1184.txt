Antimicrobial activity of Aspergillus niger synthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticles
Nanoparticles synthesised by fungi have various applications and is much effective than the nanoparticles synthesised by other means. The present study is aimed to determine the antimicrobial potential of Titanium dioxide nanoparticles synthesised from the fungus, Aspergillus niger. The synthesised nanoparticles were characterised using UV spectrophotometer, SEM, and XRD. The antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles was tested against Bacillus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus sp. Maximum zone of inhibition was observed against Pseudomonas (21mm). Titanium dioxide nanoparticles were coated on 100% cotton fabric. The cotton fabric impregnated with TiO2 was tested for its antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei. Maximum zone of inhibition was found to be 65 mm against T.reesi. Hence, fungi synthesized Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are proven to be effective antimicrobial agent. The characterization study supported to confirm the size of nano-TiO2.
