Studies of chemically deposited Cdx-1 NxS thin films
Cadmium Nickel sulfide (CdNiS) thin films were grown on glass slides by chemical bath deposited (CBD) technique. The optical and compositional studies of the films were done. These analyses were done using a Janway 6405 UVVIS spectrophotometers and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) respectively. The effects of variations of the concentration of Nickel Chloride ion on the optical and composition of the growing films were revealed. The optical analysis indicated that the grown films can be applied as solar control coating antireflection films and warming coatings. The compositional study indicates that the prepared films are rich in and the S- is almost constant. It also revealed that as the ion concentration increases, the Cd2+ decreases
