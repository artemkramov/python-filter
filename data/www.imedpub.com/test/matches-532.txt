Aflatoxin B1 induced developmental neurotoxicity in RIR egg
Present study has identified developmental neurotoxicity of 5ng and 10ng aflatoxin B1 on day ‘0’ in ovo exposure of RIR eggs. AFB1 exposure to developing chick is associated with significant elevation of total protein and depletion of glucose in brain and serum. The activity of AChE, MAO-A and MAO-B were significantly decreased by in ovo AFB1 exposure. Moreover, AFB1 caused significant depletion of glutamate level where as tryptophan level was increased in AFB1 treatment groups. These results suggest that in ovo exposure to AFB1 may cause alterations in various neurotransmitters which may be resulted into brain deformities in developing embryo.
