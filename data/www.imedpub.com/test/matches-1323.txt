Functional characterization of E2 gene of high risk oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) 16
In consistent to the fact that HPV sequence variations possibly influence virus carcinogenic potential, change in amino acid sequence of HPV-16 E5 protein might modify the transforming activity of the protein by affecting the interactions with the EGFR or potentially, other cellular proteins. In addition, it has been proposed that those variations in the E2 protein may affect the transforming potential of HPV-16 owing to changed affinity for cellular transcription factors or for viral DNA. In the present study, HPV 16 DNA was isolated from cervical cancer tissue using the specific primer designed by the Primer 3 plus software for the HPV antigen E2 gene. The amplified gene was ligated with T vector (pTZ57R/T) and transformed into DH5α cells. The plasmid DNA obtained was then confirmed by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. The sequence was found to be 99% similar to that obtained in GenBank. Dendrogram was constructed using ClustalW software to get the similarity of the sequence with the existing sequence in the NCBI. Further research is required to express the gene to get the protein antigen for the production antibodies or effective vaccine against high risk Papilloma virus.In consistent to the fact that HPV sequence variations possibly influence virus carcinogenic potential, change in amino acid sequence of HPV-16 E5 protein might modify the transforming activity of the protein by affecting the interactions with the EGFR or potentially, other cellular proteins.
