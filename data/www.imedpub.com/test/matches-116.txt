Thermosolutal Convection in Compressible, Rotating Couple-Stress Fluid in The Presence of Magnetic Field
The effect of uniform vertical magnetic field and uniform vertical rotation on thermosolutal convection in a layer of an electrically conducting couple-stress fluid heated and soluted from below is considered. For the case of stationary convection, it is clear that stable solute gradient, magnetic field, couple-stress postpone the onset of the convection, where as rotation hastens the onset of convection in compressible, couple-stress fluid heated from below in the presence of a magnetic field. Graphs have been plotted by giving numerical values to the parameters to depict the stability characteristics. Further, the solute gradient, magnetic field, rotation is found to introduce oscillatory modes in the systems that were non-existent in their absence. The sufficient conditions for the non-existence of overstability are also obtained.
