Effect of sugar industry effluent on changes of growth and biochemical contents of Capsicum annuum. L
The physico-chemical characteristics of Sugar industry effluent were measured by standard methods. The pot culture experiment was conducted with different concentrations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% &amp; 100%) of Sugar industry effluent .The effect of sugar industry effluent on Capsicum annuum. L. at day’s interval 10th, 20 th, and 30th was observed. The present study was initially conducted the effect of different concentrations of Sugar industry effluent on seed germination, plant growth and biochemical parameters of Capsicum annuum .L. The plant growth was significantly reduced with increase in concentration of the effluent. At higher effluent concentrations (above 50%) were found to affect plant growth and decreased Chlorophyll-a, Chlorophyll-b and total Chlorophyll and Protein contents, but diluted effluent (up to 50% ) favored the plant growth and biochemical contents
