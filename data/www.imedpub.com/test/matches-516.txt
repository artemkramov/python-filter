Effects of viscous dissipation of permeable fluid on laminar mixed convection in a vertical double passage channel
The fully developed flow and heat transfer in a vertical double passage channel containing permeable fluid is studied analytically using regular perturbation method. The Brinkman model is used for flow through porous media, viscous and Darcy dissipation terms are included in the energy equation. The channel is divided into two passages by means of a thin, perfectly conductive baffle and the walls are uniformly heated. The effect of porous parameter s and mixed convection parameter l on the velocity and temperature profiles near the hot and cold wall are analyzed. The result shows that these effects mainly depend on the baffle position.
