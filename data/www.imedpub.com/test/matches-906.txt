Effect of chemical reaction on slip flow of MHD Casson fluid over a stretching sheet with heat and mass transfer
The two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stagnation-point flow of electrically conducting non-Newtonian Casson fluid and heat transfer towards a stretching sheet in the presence of mass transfer and chemical reaction is considered. Implementing similarity transformations, the governing momentum, and energy equations are transformed to self-similar nonlinear ODEs and numerical computations are performed to solve those. The investigation reveals many important aspects of flow and heat and mass transfer. If velocity ratio parameter (B) and momentum slip parameter (S), magnetic parameter (M) increase, then the velocity boundary layer thickness becomes thinner. On the other hand, for Casson fluid it is found that the velocity boundary layer thickness is larger compared to that of Newtonian fluid. The magnitude of wall skin-friction coefficient reduces with Casson parameter () and also wall skin-friction coefficient increases with S for B&lt;1 whereas decreases with S for B&gt;1. The heat and mass transfer rate is enhanced with increasing values of velocity ratio parameter. The rate of heat transfer is reduces with increasing thermal slip parameter b. Moreover, the presence of chemical reaction reduces concentration
