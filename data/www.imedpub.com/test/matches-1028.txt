In-vitro antioxidant activity of Datura stramonium L. leaves
Plants contain various secondary metabolites such as saponin, steroids, flavonoids, and alkaloids, which have shown antioxidant activity that includes scavenging free radical species, inhibiting the production of reactive species, inhibiting the production of reactive species resulting from normal cell metabolism. The present study was undertaken to analyse the antioxidant activity of various extract of Datura stramonium leaves. Standard methods were adopted to assess antioxidant activity and phytochemical nature of the plant materials. The extent of radical scavenging was determined by calculated IC50 value. The results revealed that hexane, aqueous, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts showed good antioxidant activity when compared to Ascorbic acid standard. The ethyl acetate soluble fractions have shown the maximum activity among all.
