Estimation of Boron Concentration in Soil Samples in Al-Zubair, Abu-khasib and Al-mdiana districts of Basrah governorates using SSNTDs Techniques
A technical method has been used to measure the boron concentration in soil samples in the Basra governorate by detecting alpha track density in CR-39 plastic detector. The measurements were performed by analyzing the soil samples collected from 39 location using SSNTDs method. The Boron concentrations which are obtained ranged from 0.512 ppm in Eastren star to 3.581 ppm in Alnagme in soils samples. The results are presented and compared with other studies. The results could be utilized to make distinctive supplementary contributions when contamination event occurs and to implement soil quality standards by concerned authorities to maintain radioactive contamination-free drinking water supplies for the people. The study further reveals that 39 surface soil samples have boron below detection limit. It may be due to higher leaching of boron during monsoon rains from surface soils beyond the root zone. Thus, there is possibility of severe pollution problem with boron in near future.
