Microbial analysis of brands of multivitamin syrups marketed in Maiduguri, Northeast Nigeria
This study investigated the microbial contamination of seven (7) brands of multivitamin syrups marketed in Maiduguri metropolis, Borno state. The study is aimed at evaluating the microbial quality of different brands of multivitamin preparations from various manufacturers marketed in Maiduguri. Pour plate method was used. Preliminary investigation revealed that one out of the seven different samples contains pathogenic organisms which became pertinent for further investigation to reveal the identity of the organism. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus and Salmonella were investigated but only salmonella was found to be present. The other six samples also contain non pathogenic organisms, but were below the limit count set by microbiological quality of syrups. This finding showed that most multivitamin syrups marketed in Maiduguri followed Pharmacopoeia specifications on microbial quality.
