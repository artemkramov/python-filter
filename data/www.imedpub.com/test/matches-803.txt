Effect of RE Dopant (Ce &amp; Tb) on PL and Crystallites size of Lanthanum Phosphor (LaPO4)
The present paper reports the Photoluminescence (PL) of the LaPO4 phosphor doped with Ce,and Tb rare-earth ions, keeping Ce, concentration constant and varying Tb concentration as 0.1, 0.5,1.5%.The phosphors were synthesized using the standard solid state reaction technique and ground using mortar and pestle, fired at 1200oC for 4 hour in a muffle furnace. The crystallinity and particle morphology of the product were characterized by using XRD, SEM and particle size analysis. Also the effects of dopants on the Photoluminescent properties of the samples were studied using Spectrofluorophotometer at room temperature.
