Therapeutic studies on subclinical mastitis associated with subclinical hypocalcaemia and hypoglycemia in crossbred cattle
In the present research recorded the incidence of subclinical mastitis in 1599 quarter milk samples from 417 apparently healthy lactating cows by california mastitis test and electrical conductivity test. Based on in vitro drug sensitivity of mastitis milk antibiotics were selected and treated with Enrofloxacin, Chloramphenicol, Amoxycillin + Sulbactum, Ceftrioxone + tazobactum, Ceftrioxone + Sulbactum and Ceftizoxime into the affected cows. For conducting therapeutic trials cows were grouped into different groups. Cows treated with combination of antibiotic along with calcium supplement (Calup gel) had improvement in calcium levels compared to antibiotic treated group only. In another group of animals glucose supplement (ketonil gel) was done along with routine antibiotic therapy. In this group also ketone bodies levels were reduced than compare with group treated with antibiotic only.
