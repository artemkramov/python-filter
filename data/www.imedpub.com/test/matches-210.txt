Interpretation of groundmagnetic data in Oke-Ogba Area, Akure, Southwestern Nigeria
xGroundmagnetic method was used to delineate into the subsurface in Oke-Ogba area, Akure, which falls within latitude 070 14′ to 070 19′ North and longitude 0050 06′ to 0050 12′ East Southwestern Nigeria, with a view to determining the competent areas for engineering purposes and the promising areas for hydrogeologic prospects. A total of four traverses were established for the purpose of the groundmagnetic study, and the results were presented as groundmagnetic profiles of varying magnetic intensities. The result of investigation revealed that the intensities and characteristics nature of the magnetic anomalies as expressed by all profiles are indicative of the different rock types producing them. Qualitative and quantitative interpretation of individual magnetic anomaly and geological knowledge of the survey area yielded information on the depth of geological features (e.g. rock contact, faults or fractures), structures and magnetic properties of rock units. From the preliminary interpretation, the existence of some structural features such as a likely fault, fracture and contacts between rocks as well as relatively mineralized zones that might contain magnetic minerals of essential magnetite origin is revealed. It was also revealed that Oke- Ogba area, Akure, Southwestern Nigeria is averagely competent for both engineering purposes and hydrogeologic purposes.
