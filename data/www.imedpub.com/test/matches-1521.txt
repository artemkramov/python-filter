Closed form solution of heat and mass transfer past an inclined oscillating surface with Newtonian heating under the effect of thermal radiation and mass diffusion
An exact solution of the unsteady free convection boundary-layer flow of an incompressible fluid past an inclined oscillating plate with the flow generated by Newtonian heating in the presence of radiation is presented here. The resulting coupled linear partial differential equations for the velocity, the temperature and the concentration are non-dimensionalized and their solutions have been obtained in closed form with the help of Laplace-transform technique. The obtained solutions satisfy governing equations as well as the boundary conditions. A parametric study of all involved parameters is conducted and a representative set of numerical results for the velocity, temperature, concentration, skin-friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number is illustrated graphically and physical aspects of the problem are discussed in detail.
