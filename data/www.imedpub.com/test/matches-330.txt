Numerical contribution to the passive ventilation of the bioclimatic housing model
This study reports a passive ventilation of bioclimatic type housing adapted to Burkina Faso tropical hot and dry climate. The numerical simulation of our bioclimatic housing model led to optimal parameters such as roof inclination α= 55°, North-South roof orientation, the nature of building materials (BBBPP), the distance d= 0.30 m and the chimney is 0.45 m high, impacting on the rate of air ventilated in the roof and the average temperature of the air in the house. The numerical simulation of these optimal parameters produced an average air temperature in the house of 27.69°C, and an air flow of 0.092 m3s-1, flowing by natural convection in the roof. However, the flow still remains fairly low and air temperature within the house remains high as compared the standard (24°C to 27°C). These results also show that kenaf fibers and cotton wastes may be used as thermal insulator in bioclimatic housing roof. We partly reached our objective initially set, namely modelling and simulating the thermal behavior of a bioclimate thermal model adapted to hot and dry tropical climate. Yet, our study remains a major step in investigating local building materials and finding solutions to the crucial issue of energy consumption by active air processing equipment.
