Assessment of groundwater quality with reference to its portability in near vicinity of lignite mine at Matano Madh, Kachchh, Gujarat, India
Coal is one of the most influencing factors on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of any developing and developed country. Lignite source in Gujarat is one of the strongest reasons for the industrial development. Lignite has been found ever since Laki shales of Eocene age in the Kachchh district. The other side of lignite mine is adverse foot print to ground water contamination by its leachate. Ground water resources play pivotal role for people who leaves in arid region like Kachchh and they always strives on their foot to get drinking water. Thus, the present analysis was undertaken with an objective to determine the ground water quality appraisal. Parameters like temperature, pH, TDS, EC, Alkalinity, Total hardness, Calcium and Magnesium dependent hardness, COD, BOD, DO, Nitrate, Fluoride, lead and copper have studied. Analysis was performed using standard methods of American Public Health Association (APHA, 1998) for water quality appraisal. Total seventy ground water samples from six villages within approximately 10 km radium of mining area have been collected for the study. The result revealed average temperature of GW was 24.18Ã¢ÂÂ°C; pH was 6.4 which is slightly acidic and might be due to leachate from mining. Average Fluoride concentration was 2.4 ppm which may cause bone related problem if water use for drinking purpose. Average lead concentration in ground water is around 0.07 ppm which is little higher than the standard value. Moreover, significant alternation was also found in parameters like COD, DO, Alkalinity and hardness. Outcome of the results strongly recommend water treatment before use for portable purpose
