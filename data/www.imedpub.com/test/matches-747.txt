A formalism to compute the electromagnetic compatibility of complex networks
The purpose of our work is to develop a method to compute the electromagnetic compatibility of complex networks. We starts from the tensorial analysis of networks developed by Sir Gabriel KRON in 1939[1] extended with the antennas interactions [2]. We add the hybrid tensors concept developed by A.REINEIX and O.MAURICE[3] to define a multidomain metric (hybrid metric). The result is a generalized tensorial equation representing the problem to solve. Many validations of the technique exist today, given through references. The French army project DIAMANTS (DIAkoptic Methodology for ANalysis of Disturbances on Systems) has for purpose to begin a first automatisation of the method. The paper presents the basic concepts, then details the tensorial equation to resolve for one network and in conclusion, presents the future works to construct a system of networks. The method is a topological one, using the union operation of the topology [15] to construct complex networks from simple ones
