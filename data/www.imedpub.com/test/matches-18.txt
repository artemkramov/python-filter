Enhancement of antioxidant compound in Tylophora indica (Asclepeadaceae) callus
The accumulation of kaempferol was evaluated in undifferentiated callus of Tylophora indica through TLC, HPTLC analysis with standard reference compound. Kaempferol is a strong antioxidant and help to prevent oxidative damage to our cells, lipids and DNA. In the present investigation, we have enhanced the kaempferol content in Tylophora indica tissue culture by using precursors like sallicyclic acid, ornithine, cinnamic acid, tyrosin and phenylalanine in different concentration(10 and 20 mg/100 ml ).Here we have used static as well as suspension culture to enhanced the kaempferol concentration . The callus of Tylophora indica was initiated and maintained on MS ( Murashige and Skoog’s ) medium supplemented with 3% of sucrose, while Zenk production media was used as production media. A remarkable enhancement in kaempferol content was obtained by using 20 mg /100 ml of tyrosin (1.49% dw; control -0.096%dw) in suspension culture ,which is more than tenfold increase. The enhancement of kaempferol in callus of Tylophora indica by using these amino acids was reported for the first time.
