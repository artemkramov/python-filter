Facile biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles exploiting optimum pH and temperature of fresh water algae Chlorella pyrenoidusa
In this paper biosynthesis of stable gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using Chlorella pyrenoidusa extract is demonstrated. The most influential parameters for the synthesis of GNPs were pH 8, 1000C and 100 ppm aurochlorate salt. The results were verified using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD and High Resolution Transmission electron microscopy. HRTEM micrographs as well as the SPR peaks of UV-Vis spectra showed that the size of the GNPs ranged from 25- 30 nm. The HRTEM demonstrated that at alkaline pH (8, 10) spherical nanoparticles were formed whereas pH 4 showed formation of anisotropic nanostructures. The Nitrate reductase activity was found to be 0.7245 mmole/min/gram in algal extract, which got reduced to 0.5244 mmole/min/gram after the formation of GNPs.
