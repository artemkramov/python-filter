Landuse pattern in Perambalur district using spatial information technology
land use/land cover is required to central all scientific studies that aims to understand the terrestrial dynamics and is required to local to global scale to aid planning while safe guarding the environmental concerns. It is well known that land use/land cover have great impact on the economic and social development of the region. Remote sensing is an effective and economic means o collect the data and to monitor the changes occurring in land use categories. Knowledge of the present distribution and area of such agricultural, recreational, and urban lands, as well as information on their changing proportions, is needed by legislators, planners, and State and local governmental officials to determine better land use policy, to project transportation and utility demand, to identify future development pressure points and areas, and to implement effective plans for regional development. The aim of this study is to analyze the Land use Land cover for Perambalur District using the remote sensing, to evaluate the agricultural resource using GIS and GPS technology
