Depositional environments of sam-bis oil field reservoir sands, Niger Delta, Nigeria
Geological analysis of core samples and qualitative interpretation of wireline log shapes aided the identification of seven depositional environments of various sand units in Sam-Bis oil field. These include distributary channels, mouth bar, point bar, tidal channel, tidal flat, middle shoreface and lower shoreface. Percentage volume of shale calculated and documented flowage and storage properties of typical sand units show that the environments of deposition formed very good reservoirs with few exceptions. The sedimentary core log of two cored hydrocarbon bearing intervals showing depositional interpretation and key sedimentary structures observed in core samples reflects heterogeneities associated with sedimentary processes; that can have impact on hydrocarbon recovery.
