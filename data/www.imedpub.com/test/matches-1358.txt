Synthesis and characterization of methyl methacrylate and 4-vinylpyridine grafted silk fiber for dye uptake studies
Graft copolymerization of binary monomer mixture of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 4-vinylpyridine (VP) onto silk fiber was carried out by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as initiator in aqueous medium. Characterization of graft copolymers were done by various chemical and physical techniques like FTIR,TGA, SEM, moisture absorbance and chemical resistance in acidic and alkaline medium. Swelling properties of graft copolymers were studied in various solvents like water, methanol, dimethyl formamide and butanol. Gentian violet, dye uptake studies of graft copolymer was performed photo-calorimetrically
