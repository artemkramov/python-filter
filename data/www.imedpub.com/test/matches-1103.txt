Classification and specification of lineaments using gis and remote sensing techniques for western Cauvery delta, Thanjavur and Thiruvarur districts, Tamil Nadu, India
Detailed geological structure study of western Cauvery delta in Thanjavur and Thiruvarur district induced new idea about different types, classification and specification of Lineaments. In delta region, generally rift causes development of much subsequent fracture system. This fracture system has identified through geo information techniques and classified as Micro and Macro level lineaments based on their length, orientation, Azimuth principle and arrangement of vegetation. Lineament study is used to identify past tectonic trends and seismic risk assessment also lineament classification map much useful for Earth quake resistant design engineers and it is differ from seismicity map. For this study GIS and Remote Sensing techniques contribute major role and IRS PS LISS IV satellite image has used
