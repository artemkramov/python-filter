Hydromagnetic two-layered fluid slip-flow between two parallel porous walls
An attempt is made to investigate the hydromagnetic two-layered fluid flow driven by a constant pressure gradient in a horizontal channel under the action of uniform strong magnetic field in the slip-flow regime. Closed form solutions for the velocity and temperature distributions in the two regions are obtained by assuming that the fluids in the two regions are incompressible, immiscible and electrically conducting. Further, the two fluids are assumed to have different viscosities, electrical and thermal conductivities. The transport properties of the two fluids are taken to be constant and the bounding walls are maintained at constant and equal temperatures. The profiles are plotted after obtaining the numerical values for different sets of values of the governing parameters involved and discussed in detail by analyzing these parameters such as, slip parameter, porous parameter, Hartmann number, ratio’s of the viscosities, heights, electrical and thermal conductivities
