A novel method for preparation of bismuth(III) carbonate basic (BiO)2CO3.3H2O upon the reaction of urea with various bismuth(III) salts at high temperature
Bismuth(III) carbonate basic, (BiO)2CO3.3H2O, was prepared via novel simple synthetic route through the reaction of aqueous solutions of BiCl3, Bi(NO3)3, Bi(CH3COO)3 or Bi2(SO4)3 with a simple organic precursor like urea at ~ 90 oC for 72 hrs. The infrared spectra of the results indicate absence of the individual bands of urea, but exhibited of the characteristic band of ionic carbonate, CO3 2–. A general reaction mechanisms describing the preparation of bismuth(III) carbonate basic compound was discussed.
