A nonilinear variation approach to the study of compressible fluid flow.
In this paper, an attempt has been made to provide an approximation method for the analysis of fluid flow. The steady flow of a noniviscous compressible fluids were examined and it is discovered that uniqueness of solution requires that the –  (pressure) be convex for subsonic flow. For there to be flow, mass and momentum must be conserved.
