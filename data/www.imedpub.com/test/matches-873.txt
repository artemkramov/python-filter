Fractured basement reservoir identification using geophysical well log data, Gulf of Suez, Egypt
Naturally fractured reservoirs produced hydrocarbon from several localities throughout the world. The fractured reservoirs can be fractured sandstone, fractured carbonate or fractured basement. In this concern, four types of fractured reservoirs were identified according to the contribution of fractures. The fractured basement reservoir is the one, in which fractures provide the essential porosity and permeability. In the southern Gulf of Suez, Egypt, several oil fields have been produced hydrocarbon from fractured basement, such as Zeit Bay, Hilal, Ashrafi and Shoab Ali. In this study, we used conventional geophysical well logs, routine core analysis and 2D seismic data to identify the fractured basement in some bore holes distributed throughout the southern Gulf of Suez, Egypt. The results indicate that the productive wells from fractured basement usually overlain by a hydrocarbon column from which they are sourced. The results show also that all the studied wells contain fractured rocks at the top of the basement interval with varying of thickness from one well to another. It can be concluded also that the well logs are powerful tools to identify the fractured basement especially resistivity and FIL logs.
