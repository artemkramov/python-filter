Electrical properties of green synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nano particles are successfully synthesized by the green synthesis with simple solvothermal method using a domestic microwave oven, for the first time, the prepared samples were annealed at 400 oC for 3 hr to improve the ordering. Grain sizes and nano particles structure are confirmed by carrying out X-ray powder diffraction measurements. The photoconductivity measurement exhibits the positive photoconductive nature of the systems studied. AC and DC electrical measurements are done on pelletised samples at various temperatures ranging from 308 K- 368 K. The electrical parameters increase with the increase in temperature. Results of the present study reveal that the space charge contribution plays a significant role in the charge transport process and polarizability in the nano particles studied. The present study indicates the possible occurrence of nano-confined states in the TiO2 nano particles studied.
