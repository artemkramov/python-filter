Pectinase production and purification from Bacillus subtilis isolated from soil
Pectinases are industrially important enzymes. The aim of this work was the isolation of pectinases producing Bacillus species from soil sample and their identification by phenotypic tests as well as production and purification pectinases enzyme. Isolated bacteria Subjected to various screening activity and gives pectinases screening test positive i.e. bacteria produced pectinases enzyme. The enzyme produced and purified By Ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by Dialysis and ion-exchange chromatography
