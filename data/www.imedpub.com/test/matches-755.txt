Geochemical fractionation of some heavy metals in soils in the vicinity of sukinda mining Area, Orissa
Geochemical fractionation of selected heavy metal in soils from Sukinda mining area was studied using single and sequential extraction technique. The concentration pattern was observed as: Al &gt; Cr &gt; Zn &gt; Cu. The average concentration of total copper, chromium, zinc and aluminum was 10.18 μg g-1, 11336μg g-1, 84.64μg g-1 and 20832 μg g-1, respectively. Watersoluble fraction of heavy metals were quite low (0.06-3.36%) except Cr which account 21%, but presence of chelating agents increase the bio-availability (6-34%). Sequential extraction for the speciation of elements among the geochemical phases indicates that most of the metals were associated to carbonate and reducible fraction. Data shows that most of the fractions of investigated heavy metals were in the potentially available as 96%, 97%, 93%, and 88% for Cu, Cr, Zn, and Al, respectively. Further it may be revealed that Cr is most available than Cu, Zn and Al. Gradually mobilized by biogeochemical processes and thus, soils contaminants can contaminate water supplies and impact food chain.
