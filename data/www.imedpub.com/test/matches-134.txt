Branch and bound technique to two stage flow shop scheduling problem in which setup time is separated from processing time and both are associated with probabilities including job block criteria
This paper presents an algorithm with the help of branch and bound approach for a flowshop scheduling problems consisting of n jobs to be processed on 2 machines in which setup time is separated from processing time and both are associated with probabilities including job block criteria.
