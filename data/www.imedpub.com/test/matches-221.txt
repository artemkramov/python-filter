Effects of radiation on transient MHD free convective Couette flow in a rotating system
The effects of radiation on MHD free convection of a viscous incompressible fluid confined between two vertical walls in a rotating system have been studied. We have considered the flow due to the impulsive motion of one of the walls and the flow due to accelerated motion of one of the walls. The governing equations are solved analytically using the Laplace transform technique. The variations of fluid velocity components, fluid temperature and shear stress at the moving wall are presented graphically. It is found that the velocity components decrease for both the impulsive as well as the accelerated motion of one of the walls with an increase in radiation parameter. There is an enhancement in fluid temperature as time progresses. An increase in the radiation parameter leads to decrease the temperature of the flow field. The absolute value of the shear stresses at the moving wall due to the primary and the secondary flows for both the impulsive and the accelerated motion of one of the walls increases with an increase in either rotation parameter or radiation parameter. The rate of heat transfer at the moving wall increases with an increase in radiation parameter.
