Single cell protein potential of endophytic fungi associated with bamboo using rice bran as substrate
The study was undertaken to identify the isolated endophytic fungi associated with bamboo and to determine their potential in single cell protein production using rice bran as substrate. Nine endophytic fungi were identified which include Cladosporium cladosporioides, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium citrinum, Monascus ruber, Fusarium semitectum, Fusarium sp1 and Fusarium sp2. After which, their potential as sources of single cell protein using rice bran as substrate was evaluated through their crude protein content(CPC) after 20 days of solid state fermentation. Results of the study revealed that inoculation of endophytic fungi had increased the crude protein content of rice bran. Aspergillus niger- treated rice bran had the highest CPC of 10.63% followed by A. flavus- treated rice bran with 10.46% and A. ochraceus and F. semitectum- treated rice bran both with 10.25% On the other hand, uninoculated rice bran registered the least CPC of 9.53% followed by C. cladosporioides- treated rice bran of 9.69%. For the percentage increase CPC, A. niger, A.flavus and A.ochraceus and F. semitectum- treated rice bran registered the highest percentage increase of 11.51%, 9.48% and 5.25%, respectively. Hence, indicating the potential of the endophytic fungi in enriching the CPC and possible sources of single cell protein.
