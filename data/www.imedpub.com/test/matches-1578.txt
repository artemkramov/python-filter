An analysis of technical efficiency of ginger crop production in Jaba local government area, Kaduna State, Nigeria
Using a cross sectional data obtained through a multistage sampling technique, this study estimated the technical efficiency of Ginger crop production in Jaba Local Government Area, Kaduna State, Nigeria and further examined the factors that determined the differential in efficiency index. A total of 78 Ginger crop farmers in the study area were randomly selected for the study. The stochastic frontier production model was used in the analysis to determine the relationship between output and the level of input used in the study area. The empirical results revealed that farm size,. Planting materials, fertilizers and hired labour were statistically significant at 5% level while chemicals and family babour were not statistically significant. The estimated gamma parameters (γ) of 0.37 indicated that 37% of the total variation in total output was due to technical inefficiencies of the respondents. The mean technical efficiencies (χ) level was 0.68. It was therefore concluded that there is scope for increasing the technical efficiency of ginger crops production by 0.68% with the present technology. Therefore the study confirmed that increased land, planting material, fertilizer and hired labour can be used in the area by the farmers in ginger production.
