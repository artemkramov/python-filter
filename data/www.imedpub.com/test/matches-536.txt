Physicochemical characterization of exudates from Raffia Palm (Raphia hookeri)
The Physicochemical properties and mineral element composition of exudates from Raffia palm (Raphia hookeri) were investigated. The proximate composition of the exudates shows that it contains moisture (90.14%), crude protein (2.5%), ash (9.5%), crude fat (2.64%), crude fiber (0.00%), carbohydrate (85.4%) and calorific value (375kcal/100g). Mineral composition (mg/100g) of the exudates was as follows: Calcium (55.31), Magnesium (26.60), Sodium (23.63), Potassium (20.95), Manganese (8.54), Cobalt (4.77) and Iron (4.57). The anti-nutrients evaluated (mg/100) in the exudates were Hydrocyanic acid (23.76), soluble Oxalate (44.00), total oxalates (61.60) and Phytic acid (7.82). These results indicate that the anti-nutrients and mineral elements present in the exudates are within acceptable levels for humans. The high amount of carbohydrate and low level of the toxicants present in the exudates makes it highly recommendable for use as an additive in food.
