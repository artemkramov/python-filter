Antimicrobial activity of selected medicinal plants against some selected human pathogenic bacteria
The methanol, ethanol and aqueous extracts of seven medicinal plants were evaluated for activity against medically important bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp. The invitro antimicrobial activity was performed by agar well diffusion method and disc diffusion method. antimicrobial activity was performed by agar well diffusion and disc diffusion method. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts showed minimum antimicrobial activity when compared to methanolic extracts. The methanolic extract Phyllanthus niruri (stone breaker) showed the maximum activity against Staphylococcus sp. The use of plant extracts with known antimicrobial properties, can be of great significance in therapeutic treatments.
