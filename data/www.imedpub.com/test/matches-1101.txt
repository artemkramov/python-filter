Soil analysis is a chemical processes that determine the amount of available plant nutrients in the soil &amp; by determining the parameter we are able to achieve good soil health[2].We have collected 20 soil samples of various villages adjacent to Sabarmati river according to standard method suggested by literature &amp; analyzed in our laboratory. We have determined primary nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K ), OC(Organic Carbon) ,pH, EC, &amp; macro nutrient like Ca Mg, , S, &amp; micronutrients like Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn of all the samples &amp; seen a significant variation.
