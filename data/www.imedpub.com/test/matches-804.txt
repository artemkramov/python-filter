Growth and characterization of some chlorides doped n-benzoyl glycine crystals
Pure and Chlorides doped n-benzoyl glycine (Hippuric acid) single crystals have been grown by slow evaporation technique at room temperature. The crystal system has been identified and lattice dimensions have been measured using X-ray diffraction analysis. The functional groups of the grown crystals were qualitatively examined using FTIR analysis. Its optical character has been assessed by UV- spectral transmission analysis. The thermal behavior of the crystals has been investigated by TGA/DTA analysis
