The Influence of Ge content on Physical Parameters of GexSb35-xTe65 Glass System
The investigation of composition dependence of various properties of chalcogenide glasses has been increased in recent years. In the present work, the effect on the physical properties viz. average coordination number, mean bond energy, glass transition temperature, Average heat of atomization etc., with the variation in Ge content has been studied theoretically for GexSb35-xTe65 (x = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 at. %) glassy semiconductors. It has been found that almost all the parameters, studied here, except the paramete
