Adsorption studies for removal of organochlorine pesticides using modified unsaturated polyester resin
Organochlorine pesticides in water are of great concern due to their stable nature and chronic adverse effect on human health as well as on environment. Organochlorine pesticides such as DDT, aldrin, dialdrin etc. were commonly used in agricultural and some dieses preventing activities. Also surface water which is used as drinking water contains highly concentrate values of these pesticides becomes a choice for its adsorption studies. Hence, the mixture of polymer and other natural low cost materials have been employed for removal of organochlorine pesticides from pharmaceutical waste. Effect of these organochlorine pesticides was investigated by different adsorption parameters such as contact time, pH value, and concentration.
