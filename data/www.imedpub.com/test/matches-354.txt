Heat transfer in MHD flow of a dusty fluid over a stretching sheet with viscous dissipation
An analysis has been carried out to study the magnetohydrodynamic boundary layer flow and heat transfer characteristics of a dusty fluid over a flat stretching sheet in the presence of viscous dissipation. The basic equations governing the flow and heat transfer are in the form of partial differential equations, the same have been reduced to a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations by applying suitable similarity transformation. The transformed equations are solved numerically by applying Runge Kutta Fehlberg fourth-fifth order method (RKF45 Method). The effects of fluid-particle interaction parameter, Chandrasekhar number, Prandtl number, Eckert number on heat transfer characteristics for two general cases namely, the prescribed surface temperature (PST) case and the prescribed wall heat flux (PHF) case are presented graphically and discussed. The skin friction and heat transfer coefficients are tabulated for a range of values of the parameters. Comparison of the obtained numerical results is made with existing literature.
