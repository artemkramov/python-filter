Effect of deposition time on the optical properties of antimony sulphide thin films grown by the solution growth technique
Thin films of antimony sulphide (Sb2S3) were grown on soda-lime glass substrate using the solution growth technique. The deposition time was varied between 1h to 5h and the other deposition variables were kept constant. The results show that the film thickness increased with an increase in the deposition time, and attained a maximum thickness at the deposition time of 4h. From the optical characterisation done using a UV-spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 1250 nm, it was observed that the optical constant; energy bandgap, extinction coefficient, and the optical density varied with the deposition time. The extinction coefficient was in the range 0.01 to 0.27 while the optical density varied from 0.01 to 0.34. The optical energy bandgap was in the range of 2.05 eV to 2.10 eV. These values strongly suggest the possible use of the films for optoelectronic applications especially as window layers in solar cell devices.
