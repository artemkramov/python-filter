Sequence Stratigraphy of Akos Field in the Coastal Swamp Depobelt of the Niger Delta
Four major sequence boundaries dated back at 12.1 Ma, 10.6 Ma, 10.35 Ma and 8.5 Ma and three intervening Maximum Flooding Surfaces (MFS) 11.5 Ma, 10.4Ma and 9.5Ma have been respectively identified. They are denoted as Dodo shale, Nonion-4 and Uvigerina-8 markers falling within the Central Swamp depobelt of the Niger Delta. Three depositional sequences (sequence 1, 2 and 3) have been delineated, whereas sequence-1 is an incomplete sequence in most of the wells. In the wells 007, 009 and 013, it is completely lacking. Three major parasequence stacking patterns; progradational, retrogradational and aggradational as well as four systems tracts namely: Lowstand Systems Tract (LST), Transgressive Systems Tract (TST), Highstand Systems Tract (HST) and the Falling Stage Systems Tract (FSST) have been interpreted. The alternation of the reservoir sands of the LST and HST and the shale units of the TST offers excellent stratigraphic traps for hydrocarbon.
