Heavy metals evaluation of Madna StreamÃ¢ÂÂ sediment in Kubokun village of Abuja Metropolis
This research work was conducted to assess the concentration of heavy metals namely: Co, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Pb and Ni. The concentration of Cadmium, Copper, Cobalt, Iron, Lead and Nickel were determined in sediments of Madna stream, Kubokun village, Abuja using ten different sites 200m apart. The elemental determination was carried out using wet digestion with concentrated HNO3 and HCl and analysis with atomic absorption spectrometer. The concentration of heavy metals follow the trend Fe &gt; Co &gt; Ni &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Cd. For essential element it is Fe &gt; Co &gt; Cu, while the non essential elements has the trend, Ni &gt; Pb &gt; Cd. Result of the analyses show that the concentrations of all the heavy metals determined except for copper were above the WHO maximum acceptable concentration. Thus, indicating the tendency of pollution from both anthropogenic and natural sources. The level of Pd correlates positively with Co and Fe. Cu correlates negatively with Ni and Co. There is statistical significance in the level of Fe in the sediment compared to Pb, and that in Ni compared to Cu.
