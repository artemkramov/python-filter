Evidences from Palynomorph assemblages depicting Late Cretaceous age for the straddled areas of Anambra and Mid-Niger Basins
Samplings of spores and pollen assemblages were done on shale bodies from Mamu in Anambra Basin and Patti in Mid-Niger Basin. This area is straddled portion of both basins of Anambra and Mid-Niger. The straddled areas of the two basins are stratigraphically correlatable and are lateral equivalents of each other. The mappable lithostratigraphic units are Mamu Formation and Ajali Sandstone in the Anambra Basin as well as the Lokoja and Patti Formations in Mid-Niger Basin. Palynological samples from the Anambra and Mid-Niger Basins of Nigeria result in recovery of Cingulatisporites, Longapertites, Ephredites regularis, Monoporites, Echitriporites, Triporites among others characteristic of Cretaceous age and shallow marine environments
