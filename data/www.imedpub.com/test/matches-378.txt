Cultivation and study of growth of oyster mushroom on different agricultural waste substrate and its nutrient analysis
The cultivation of edible fungi is a controlled bioconservation of agro industrial lingo-cellulosic waste &amp; residues. Mushroom cultivation fits in very well with sustainable farming &amp; has several advantages. It uses agricultural waste products. A high production per surface area can be obtained, after picking the spent substrate is still a good soil conditioner. The Mushrooms are good cash crop. The development of Oyster mushroom (Grey and pink) production methodologies on agricultural waste like Paddy straw and wheat straw gives very high yield as well as the nutritional contain like carbohydrate, protein, ash, calcium, magnesium, crude fibers and lipid were checked
