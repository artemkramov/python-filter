Studies on the Influence of Long Chain Acrylic Esters Co-Polymers Grafted With Vinyl Acetate as Flow Improver Additives of Crude Oils
A variety of techniques have been employed in order to reduce problems caused by the crystallization of paraffin during the production and/or transportation of waxy crude oil. Flow improvers are used extensively to increase the mobility of crude oil. In this study, the influence of the PEAA graft co-polymer (PEAA- g-VA), as flow improver, on the viscosity and pour point of some Egyptian waxy crude oils. The produced purified and characterized by FT-IR and 1HNMR and rheological measurements. The shear rate-shear stress and shear rate-apparent viscosity were measured at different concentration (from 500 to 3000 ppm) and temperatures below and equal the pour point temperature. The copolymer leads to a large reduction in the pour point of samples of Khalda Petroleum Co. (KhPC) crude oils. The polymeric additives were diluted with xylene and added by different doses ranged from 500 to 3000 ppm to crude oil to reduce its pour point. The pour point measurements show good reduction of pour point temperature depending on the composition and location of Khalda crude oil. Thus establishing the large efficiency of the products synthesized in this work.
