Effects of shield metal arc welding techniques on the mechanical properties of duplex stainless steel
The study has compared the effects of shielded metal arc welding process on some mechanical properties of duplex stainless steel. The samples were welded and given post weld heat treatment which in lubricating and neem oils. After the analyses, it was established that duplex stainless steel can be weld successfully using shielded metal arc. Both engine oil and neem oil can serve as quenching medium for post welding heat treatment of duplex stainless steel. It was also noted that the heat treatment improved some mechanical properties of the alloy after welding, stress relief heat treatment gives better strength, compared to those that were quenched in lubricating oil and neem oil but the reverse is the case in terms of toughness
