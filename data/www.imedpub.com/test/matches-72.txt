Prevalence of ESBL pathogens in Salem Hospitals and its control
Organisms developing resistance against antimicrobial compound is the growing problem worldwide. Resistance mechanisms frequently found in every class of antibiotic agents. The detection and prevention of such resistant organisms are in major concern. With this view the present study is attempted to study the prevalence of ESBL pathogens in Salem district hospitals. Pus and urine sample collected from Salem district hospitals. The isolates are subjected for antibiotic sensitivity test by using cephalosporin antibiotic and Identified by biochemical test. ESBL resistant strains are phenotypically characterized by slime, haemolysin and beta lactamase production. Genotypic identification by using fim, pap and cnf genes for E.coli and alg-D gene for Pseudomonas. To find out the potent bioactive compound for controlling these pathogens, they are screened against six Streptomyces sp. extracts. From Fourty clinical samples morphologically distinct 53 strains of bacteria were isolated and identified as E.coli (45%), P.aeruginosa (42%), K.pneumoniae (18%) and S.aureus (40%). Four E.coli isolates and one P.aeruginosa showed resistant to antibiotic and confirmed as β-lactamase producers. In slime detection 3 E.coli and one P.aeruginosa strains showed strong positive results and 2 E.coli strains showed positive results for haemolysin. In case of beta lactamase all the isolates showed positive result. For E.coli 2 virulence genes pap (75%) and cnf (25%) are amplified and no isolates produced fim gene. 100% of algD virulence gene is amplified for Pseudomonas. Only two extracts Y1 and P7 have highest antagonistic activity against E.coli and P.aeruginosa. Conclusion: The results indicated that actinomycetes will play an essential role in protecting human health by producing novel antibiotics against resistant microorganisms
