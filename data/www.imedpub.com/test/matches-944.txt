Photocatalytic degradation of basic Fuchsin over quaternary oxide iron zinc cuprate (FeZn2cu3O6.5)
The photocatalytic activity of iron zinc cuprate was investigated taking photodegradation of Basic fuchsin dye as a model system under visible light. The photocatalyst FeZn2Cu3O6.5 was synthesized by the ceramic technique. Photocatalytic degradation of Basic fuchsin dye was observed spectrophotometrically and progress of the reaction was monitored at 544 nm. The optimum rate was observed as pH = 6.0, concentration of Basic fuchsin = 1.2 × 10-5 M, amount of FeZn2Cu3O6.5 = 0.10 g and light intensity = 50.0 mWcm-2. Quality parameters of water were also determined before and after treatment. Products received after degradation of dyes were also analyzed. A tentative has been mechanism proposed.
