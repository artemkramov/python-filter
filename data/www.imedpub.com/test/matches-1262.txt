Photoluminescent properties of LaPO4: Gd3+ phosphor
Pure LaPO4 and LaPO4:Gd3+(0.5 mol%) phosphor was synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were used to characterize the pure LaPO4 and LaPO4 :Gd3+ phosphor.The excitation spectrum of LaPO4:Gd3+phosphor monitored under 400nm wavelength was characterized by a broad band ranging from 220- 280nm with a maximum intensity peak at 249nm(4.96 eV).Upon excitation at 254nm wavelength, the emission spectrum of LaPO4:Gd3+ phosphor emits a broad band range from 400-565nm with maximum intensity peak at 469(blue)nm(2.64eV) with the full width at half maximum (1nm). The color coordinates for the LaPO4:Gd3+(0.5 mol%) phosphor are x=0.1726 and y=0.0048.This phosphor is having excellent colour tunability of blue light
