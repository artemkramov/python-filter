Recycling of the used cooking oils as corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel in hydrochloric acid corrosive medium
Alleviation of environmental pollution caused by accumulation of used cooking oils (UCO) and corrosion of steel alloys. In this respect, the used cooking oil (Triolein) was collected, Purified, then reacted with ethanol amine (EA) in the presence of sodium acetate as a catalyst, the obtained Octadec-9-enoic acid (2-hydroxy-ethyl)-amide, ( Octa Dec Hydroxy Amide ,ODHA) as nonionic surfactant which separated and characterized by FT-IR, 1HNMR was evaluated as corrosion inhibitors for steel in 1 M HCl aqueous corrosive medium by electrochemical methods( open circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization), and chemical methods(weight loss) at different concentration and temperatures It was found that the inhibition efficiency increased with inhibitor concentration and decrease with temperature. Adsorption was found to follow the Langmuir isotherm. The obtained polarization curves indicate that these compounds act as mixed-type inhibitors. Inhibition efficiency obtained from both polarization and weight loss measurements are in a good agreement.
