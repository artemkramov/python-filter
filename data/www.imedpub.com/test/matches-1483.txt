Growth of thin films of ZnO by induction heated liquid phase epitaxy
“Thin films” in today’s science and technology scenario plays an important role scientifically and also in the hightech industries. Thin films as a two dimensional system are of great importance’s to many real world problems. Their material costs are small when compared to the bulk materials but they perform the same functions technically. Thus knowledge and determination of the nature, functions and new properties of thin films can be used for the development of new technology for future applications. Thin films have very interesting properties that are quite different from those of the bulk materials which they are made up. This is because of the fact that their properties depend on a number of inter related parameters and also on the technique employed for the fabrication. The charge is taken as a supersaturated solution with an optimal texture and so that crystallization evolves easily else there is a possibility of accumulation and multiple nucleation which will prevent the film formation. Homogeneous combinations of single layered and multiple layered thin films are grown after arranging for a thin film coating using Liquid Phase Epitaxy method. Zinc Oxide thin films in pure form was coated on suitable substrates. The thin films grown by this process will be subjected to structural, functional and optical characterizations.
