Analytical Study of Effect on Hard Sphere Diameter of some organic liquids
Here, we have used theoretical computation based upon Khasare formulation “C”. Equation of State is applied to depth of potential () and temperature variation of depth of potential ( theoretical values of hard-sphere diameter to study the behaviour equal steps of 5K from 298.16 K to 313.16 K. The hard Hard-sphere diameter seems to be fairly invariable over the above temperature range.
