Quasi-static mechanical characterization and fatigue of a composite laminates
This present work focuses on the quasi- static mechanical characterization and or fatigue of a composite materials (laminate) jute/polyester manufactured under vacuum and with stacking sequences of 0/ 90. The obtained results of tensile tests on the laminate, showed a similar behavior on two levels: a linear portion up to 20 MPa and a nonlinear portion to rupture at 47 MPa σ max , followed by elongation of 2.08 % with a break elongation up to 2.50 %. Also, it was noted that increasing the temperature of the samples (5-6 ° C ) when the fatigue test remains in ISO 13003 , which requires a temperature increase of less than 10 ° C. the results of fatigue test showed also that with a loading of 50% of the maximum load reached more than one million cycle, the more load is increasing the cycle numbers of decreases
