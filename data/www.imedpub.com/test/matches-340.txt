stability of groundnut shell ash (GSA)/ordinary portland cement (OPC) concrete in Nigeria
This study investigates the use of considerable volume of groundnut shell ash as the partial replacement for cement in concrete production. A total of 100 specimens of the GSA/OPC concrete was cured in cubes of 100mm dimension for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days and the compressive strength and density determined. The percentage replacement of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) varies to the control (0% replacement) about 40%. The results generally show a decrease in density and compressive strength as the percentage replacement with GSA increases suggesting less hydration with cement. Based on a general analysis of the results as well as the logical comparison to the acceptable standard, a percentage replacement of 10% is suggested for sustainable construction, especially in mass concrete constructions.
