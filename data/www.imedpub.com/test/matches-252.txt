Lattice heat capacity of crystals: A q-oscillator debye model
The Debye model for lattice heat capacity is modified retaining all the basic assumptions except that each mode is here treated as a q-deformed quantum harmonic oscillator. The lattice heat capacity Cv is evaluated in the high and low temperature limits. When T &lt;&lt; θD, Cv α T3 and when T&gt;&gt; θD, Cv α T2. In the case of the alkali elements Rb, Cs and K whose Debye temperature are relatively low, the calculated values agree reasonably well with experimental results over a wide range of temperatures. The lattice heat capacity Cv for semiconducting elements are also studied whose Debye temperature (θD) are very large as compared to alkali elements and also studied for rare gases.
