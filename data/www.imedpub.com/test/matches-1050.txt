Interpretation of aeromagnetic data over the Bida Basin, North Central, Nigeria
The Bida basin in the North central Nigeria is studied using two (2) aeromagnetic sheet with a scale of 1:100,000 (sheet 184 and 185). The data was acquired at the Nigeria Geological survey Agency and subjected to manual digitization of fifty four (54) lines from where a total of 2398 data points were obtained. The data was then subjected to both manual and computer processed analysis which involved map merging polynomial filtering lineament analysis and depth to magnetic source estimations. The results from manual lineament trend reveals a major NW–SE dominant trend and a minor NE – SW trend, this agree with regional trend of NW – SE from computer processed analysis. The merged total intensity field map and the residual also revealed loose contour S at Bida areas typical of sedimentary basins and tightly packed contourS at Paiko representing areas from basement. The depth to magnetic sources reveals two depocenters (Kataeregi and Datoraki) with depth 4.4km and 4.8km within the Bida area, Other areas within the paiko (Lapai 0.6km, Nagadi 9.8km, and paiko 0.8km) has shallow depth sources typical of basement areas which are unsuitable for further hydrocarbon exploration. The Bida areas with sediment thickness reaching depth 4.8km are good targets for further hydrocarbon exploration activities.
