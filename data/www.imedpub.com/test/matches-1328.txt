Study on potability of water from Abna river at Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh
In the present work, water samples were collected monthly from October 2011 to September 2012 in duplicate totaling 72 water samples. The three sampling locations were: BABRI BAN (BB), THE KISHOR KUMAR MUKTIDHAM (KKM) &amp; CHHAIGAON DEVI (CHD).Quality of water is an important factor in development and use of ground water as resources. Various physico-chemical parameters like Temperature, Turbidity, pH, Hardness, Calcium, chloride, Iron, Fluoride, Carbon-dioxide and Total dissolved solids have a significant role in determining the potability of drinking water (WHO 1971)
