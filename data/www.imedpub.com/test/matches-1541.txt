Ultrasonic studies on (E)Ã¢ÂÂ2-(2-nitrobenzylidene amino)benzoic acid and its Fe(III) complex at different concentration
Ultrasonic velocity, viscosity and density of schiff base (E)–2-(2-nitrobenzylidene amino)benzoic acid and its metal complex of Fe(III) in DMSO have been measured at constant temperatures in the range of 306Kanddifferent concentration. This Schiff base was readily and conveniently accessible in high yields by green method. From the experimental data, the acoustical parameters such as adiabatic compressibility(bs), relative association(RA), specific acoustic impedance (Z), free path length (Lf), relaxation amplitude(a/f2), relaxation time (t), relative viscosity(ÃÂ&nbsp;r)etc. and their excess values have been computed and presented as functions of compositions. The acoustical parameters are explained on the basis of molecular interactions between the components of the mixtures. The variations of these parameters with composition of the mixture suggest the strength of molecular interactions in these mixtures.
