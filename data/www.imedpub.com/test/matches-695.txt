Unsteady MHD free convection flow and mass transfer near a moving vertical plate in the presence of thermal radiation
The problem of unsteady MHD free convection flow and mass transfer near a moving vertical plate in the presence of thermal radiation has been examined in detail in this paper. The governing boundary layer equations of the flow field are solved by a closed analytical form. A parametric study is performed to illustrate the influence of radiation parameter, magnetic parameter, Grashof number, Prandtl number on the velocity, temperature, concentration and skin-friction. The results are discussed graphically and qualitatively. The numerical results reveal that the radiation induces a rise in both the velocity and temperature, and a decrease in the concentration. The model finds applications in solar energy collection systems, geophysics and astrophysics, aero space and also in the design of high temperature chemical process systems.
