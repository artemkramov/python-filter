Study of Excess Thermodynamic Parameters in Binary Liquid Mixtures of ntetradecane with alkane-1-ol
Viscosities, densities and speed of sound have been measured over the whole composition range for n-tetradecane with hexan-1-ol, heptan-1-ol, octan-1-ol, decan-1-ol and dodecan-1-ol at 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure along with the properties of the pure components. Excess molar volumes, Excess isentropic compressibility and viscosity deviations for the binary systems were calculated and fitted to Redlich–Kister equation to determine the fitting parameters and the root-mean square deviations. The Prigogine–Flory–Patterson (PFP) theory and its applicability in predicting Vm E is tested. Furthermore, the theoretical values of speed of sound (u) and isentropic compressibility (ks) have also been estimated using the Prigogine–Flory–Patterson (PFP) theory with the van der Waals (vdW) potential energy model.
