Structural and optical properties of CdS thin films obtained by spray pyrolysis
Cadmium Sulphide (CdS) thin films were prepared by Chemical Spray Pyrolysis technique. Cleaned glass substrates were used. The Substrate was maintained 3000c the films were Characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of these films studied by X-ray diffraction were polycrystalline hexagonal phase. Direct band gap values of 2.42 eV -2.36 eV were obtained from optical absorption measurements. The refractive index is reported on depending on the Substrate temperature, and were obtained from transmission spectra. The thickness of these films were determined by Weighing method and in the range of t = 2289 μm, t = 2989 μm and t = 4379 μm
