Isolation of a novel iron oxidizing bacteria from the iron scraps of a steel industry
An iron-oxidizing bacterium has been isolated from the iron scraps of a steel industry. It is an aerobic obligate chemolithoautotroph. Growth occurs optimally at pH 4 and 45 to 50ºC in a mineral medium containing 9% FeSO4 but lacking organic carbon. The organism grows as cocci in clusters with sheath around each cell. The isolate is morphologically and physiologically distinct from other well characterized iron-oxidizing bacteria. The 16S rRNA sequencing suggests an uncultured bacterium clone B9-70.
