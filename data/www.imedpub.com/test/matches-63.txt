Thermal diffusion effect on MHD free convection flow of stratified viscous fluid with heat and mass transfer
The objective of this paper is to study the effect of thermal diffusion on MHD free convection flow of stratified viscous fluid past a vertical porous plate with heat and mass transfer taking Visco-elastic and Darcy resistance terms into account and the constant permeability of the medium numerically and neglecting induced magnetic field in comparison to applied magnetic field. The velocity, temperature and concentration distributions are derived and discussed graphically. It is observed that velocity increases with the increase in Gr (Grashof number), K (Permeability parameter) and A (Thermal diffusion parameter), but it decreases with the increase in M(Magnetic parameter).
