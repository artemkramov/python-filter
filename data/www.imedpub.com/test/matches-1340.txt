Transesterification of Citrullus colocynthis (Thumba) oil: Optimization for biodiesel production
An increasing demand offossil fuels has being a critical problem for us. The natural resources of fossil fuel are dwindling day by day. Biodiesel that may called natural fuel may be a good source or substitute for fossil fuel in future. Biodiesel can be produced from non edible oil like Jatrophacurcus, pongamiapinnata, Madhucaindica, Gossypiumarboreum, Simaroubaglauca etc. and more. There is a best source as a raw material that is Citrullus Colocynthisschard (Thumba) oil for biodiesel production. As it is anclimber and grows wild in western part of Rajasthan. Our study is focused on the collection of seeds and oil extraction then proceed for biodiesel production with molar ratio 8:1, KOH were 0.75wt%, tempreture 65oc, reaction time 90minutes were used and testing of parameters as per ASTM 6751 standards. The physical properties like acid value, density, Calorific value, Flash point, Fire point and Moisture, Viscosity of Thumba methyl ester (TME ) were 0.42,0.870gm/cc, 37.00MJ/Kg, 1640c, 1720c and 0.02%, 4.78 Cst found. The process variables that influence the transesterification of triglycerides, such as catalyst concentration, molar ratio of methanol to raw oil, reaction time, reaction temperature, and free fatty acids content of raw oil in the reaction system were investigated and optimized. It was concluded that TME may works as a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production that is equivalent to fissile fuel as per ASTM 6751
