Effect of decrease in chalcogen content on some physical parameters of Ge14BixSe76-xTe10 Glasses due to variation in Bi content
Currently, a lot of attention has been given to characterization and improvement of the properties of chalcogenide glasses in general and the materials exhibiting the switching phenomenon in particular. A study on effect of decrease in chalcogen content due to variation in Bismuth content on some physical parameters viz. average coordination number, number of constraints, cross-linking density, molecular weight, fraction of floppy modes, Lone-pair electron, mean bond energy, glass transition temperature etc., has been summarized in the present article for Ge14BixSe76-xTe10 (x=1.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5, 13.5, 16.5, 19.5, 22.5) glassy alloys. To study the glass transition temperature and mean bond energy, Tichy-Ticha approach has been considered. A smooth variation has been found in almost all the parameters, studied here.
