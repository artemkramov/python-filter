Identification of insecticidal properties in common weed - Lantana camara Linn by Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrum (GC-MS-MS)
Oil extracted from the leaves of Lantana camara by hydrodistillation was processed for bioactive molecules of insecticidal action against the teak defoliator, Hyblaea puera. Oil fraction analysed by GC/MS/MS has revealed major compounds of the said nature. About thirty six compounds were characterized from essential oil of L.camara, some of them like α- Copaene, Germacrene D &amp; B, α – Cubebene, β – Elemene, α – Guaiene, α – humulene , Aromadendrene, β – Selinene, α – Selinene, Caryophyllene oxide, Nerolidol, Spathulenol and Delta – Cadinene, have expressed tritrophic interactions as reported by earlier findings as well as insecticidal activity in terms of larval mortality against teak defoliator.
