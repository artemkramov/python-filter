Challenges in the study of polytypism in MX2 compounds
Lot of experimental work has been done on the polytypism of cadmium iodide and lead iodide crystals and enough data is available. In addition, a number of theories have been put forward from time to time but the origin of polytypism is not yet clear. After going through the data on the subject, a number of unanswered problems have been presented in this paper and it is suggested that with advancement of experimental facilities and computational systems both experimentalists and theorists should look into the phenomenon of polytypism again
