Assessment of faecal indicator bacteria in the coastal waters of Visakhapatnam, India
The present study investigates the presence of faecal indicator bacteria in the three stations of Visakhapatnam coast. Results showed that the total coliforms varied from13 cfu/ml to 92 cfu/ml, faecal coliforms ranged from 6 to 24 cfu/ml and E.coli is found more in station 1 and minimum in station 3. Faecal streptococci varied from 1 to 8 cfu/ml. Higher microbial densities were recorded in fishing harbour and shipyard and hence these areas were indicative of sewage pollution. Therefore monitoring the indicator organisms in the effluents is more likely to be predictive of the presence of certain pathogens in order to protect public health.
