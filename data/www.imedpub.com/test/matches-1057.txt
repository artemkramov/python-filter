Effect of chromium generated by solid waste of tannery and microbial degradation of chromium to reduce its toxicity:
Leather industries releases large amount of wastes which are in solid and liquid form. One of the likely solid wastes produced as of leather industry is chrome-tanned leather shavings(CTLS) hides, etc. Wastes releases from tannery industries contain major toxicity of chromium which releases into the environment directly or indirectly. Chromium (Cr) into the environment creates unfavorable outcomes by altering the normal physiochemical properties of soil and water. It is determined that Chromium is the principle threat of tannery industry. Cr is extremely venomous and carcinogenic to humans, animals, vegetation and as well as overall environment. Effective management of tannery waste is the necessity of the time. Although lot of alternative treatments were assessed to reduce the toxic effect of Cr on environment but none of them forced out Cr completely. In some cases researchers however successful enough working biotechnological methods to reduce the toxic effect of chromium (Cr VI). Hence treatments are either complex, expensive or not applicable worldwide due to proficient work force environment. Consequently, to tackle these challenges demanding environmental ordinance which can be practiced and approved widely over the world. This problem can be overcome by microbial degradation process which uses plants like hyper-accumulators, microbes for the treatment of contaminants. Though, it is time consuming this helps in complete restoration and pollution free process.
