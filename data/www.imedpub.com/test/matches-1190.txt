In situ synthesis and characterization of polyaniline/ nickel oxide composites
In situ polymerization of aniline was carried out in presence of nickel oxide (NiO) to synthesize polyaniline/nickel oxide (PANI/NiO) composites using chemical oxidation method. The method of synthesis is based on chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline doped with various wt % of nickel oxide by using ammonium persulphate as an oxidant. PANI and PANI/nickel oxide composites were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis and DC conductivity. FTIR and XRD results reveal the presence of NiO in the composites. Thermal stability of polymer composites has been analyzed by TGA-DTG and corresponding thermal kinetic parameters were calculated. Thermal analysis exhibits the increase in thermal stability as compared to PANI with increasing concentration of dopant up to 30 wt% and thereafter it decreases. The DC conductivity of these composites has been investigated as a function of temperature and doping concentration and results have been compared with pure PANI. DC conductivity increases with increase in temperature. The variations in DC conductivity with increase in concentration of NiO in composites have been discussed here. PANI/ NiO composites show lower DC electrical conductivity as compared to PANI. For future actions, this work opens new perspectives for the use of PANI/NiO composite as a conducting material because it has higher DC conductivity as compared to NiO.
