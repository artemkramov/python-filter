Comparative assessment of physico-chemical conditions and Plankton diversity of River Tons and Asan in Dehradun District of Uttarakhand
Plankton diversity and physico-chemical parameters are an important criterion for evaluating the suitability of water for drinking and other purposes. In the present paper a comparative study of Physico-chemical parameters and plankton diversity between river Tons and Asan in Dehradun was conducted for a period of one year from April 2011-March 2012. Water samples were taken from three sampling stations of both the rivers every month during the course of study. The samples were analysed for both Physico-chemical attributes and plankton diversity. In the present study the data collected on various physico-chemical parameters of both the rivers showed wide site fluctuations having a direct effect on plankton populations. The physico-chemical attributes of both the rivers were investigated by measuring the degree of correlation with the plankton diversity. Our findings highlighted the deterioration of water quality of both the rivers due to industrial, commercial and anthropogenic activities. The status of plankton diversity of river Asan was so low indicating that the river is highly polluted and the water chemistry have direct effect on plankton diversity. However the water quality of river Tons was good to some extent but needs urgent effective restoration and management strategies for its conservation
