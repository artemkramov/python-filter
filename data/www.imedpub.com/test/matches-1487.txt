Synthesis and characterization of graft copolymers of mulberry silk fiber with vinyl binary monomers
Binary monomer mixtures of Acrylamide (AAm) and Vinyl acetate (VAc) with methyl methacrylate (MMA) as the principal monomer were grafted onto Mulberry silk fiber in an aqueous medium by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as redox initiator. The binary vinyl monomer were graft copolymerized by using the optimum grafting conditions as reported earlier for MMA alone onto the same backbone. The evidence of grafting was obtained from FTIR, TGA and SEM. Moisture absorbance and chemical resistance in acidic and alkaline medium were studied for graft copolymers.
