Effect of gamma radiation on thermal stability of PADC-American Acrylics detector
A comparative study on thermal properties of gamma irradiated PADC-American Acrylics track detector is done in dose range of 101–106 Gy. TGA studies reveal that due to gamma exposure the thermal stability of the detector decreases at a dose higher than 104Gy. It is also observed that the post-gamma mode of exposure of the detector has got more significant effect on thermal stability then the pre-gamma mode of exposure. Due to etching of the detector, thermal stability of the detector decreases drastically at a dose of 106 Gy. The weight loss by the detector upon heating is found to be endothermic in nature and takes place in the temperature range of around 3750C. However, due to gamma exposure, this endothermic transition takes place at a lower temperature of around 3500C. Chemical etching of the detector leads to further lowering of this endothermic transition. The amount of heat involves for the endothermic process of weight loss is found to be around 5.66 J/g for the pristine sample, whereas for irradiated sample of 106 Gy, it is found to be 20.95 J/g.
