Estimation of proximate, amino acids, fatty acids and mineral composition of mullet (Mugil cephalus) of Parangipettai, Southeast Coast of India
Proximate, Amino acids, fatty acids and mineral composition of Mullet (Mugil cephalus) in the Parangipettai coastal waters analyzed in the muscles. The results revealed that the moisture, carbohydrate, lipid, protein and crude ash content of the fish species was 75.27, 1.2, 2.42, 17.56 and 1.15 , respectively. This present study shows that the muscle of flesh of Mugil cephalus contains important w-3 and w-6 fatty acids and it is best suitable for consumption. In this present study ten essential amino acids like phenylalanine, valine, tryptophan, threonine, isoleucine, methionine, histidine, arginine, leucine and lysine were detected and all are required daily by human for healthy living. Among the eight nutrient elements investigated the most abundant was K followed by Na and Ca. The rest of the other elements Fe,Zn,Mn,Mg and Se.
