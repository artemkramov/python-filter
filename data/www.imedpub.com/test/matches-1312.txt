The convection flow of aqueous humor in the anterior chamber of human eye
A simple mathematical model for the buoyancy-driven flow of aqueous humor in the anterior chamber arising from the temperature difference between the anterior surface of the cornea and the iris is developed. The model is formulated using the lubrication theory limit of the Navier-Stokes equations and classical Boussinesq model of the fluid density for thermal driven convection flow. The model takes into the account the fact that the heat loss at the corneal surface takes place not only due to the convection but also due to the radiation and evaporation. The model also incorporates Beaver- Joseph’s slip flow condition at the porous corneal surface. The expressions for the temperature and velocity profiles are derived. The computational results are presented through graphs and the effects of various model parameters on the fluid velocity distribution are investigated and discussed
