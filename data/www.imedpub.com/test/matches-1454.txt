Growth response of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to different feed ingredients incorporate diets
An experiment was conducted in glass aquaria to study the growth performance of common carp fry fed on four different feeds for 120 days. Four different feed ingredients used were fish meal + soybean+ Groundnut cake+ rice bran +wheat flour, fish meal + Groundnut cake + rice bran + wheat flour, soybean + Groundnut cake + rice bran + wheat flour and commercial cattle feed. The feed was supplied @ 5% of wet body weight of fish. The crude protein ranges from 27.1 to 35.2%. Protein content(35.2%) feed containing ingredients of Trt.-I was better for the fish growth (0.056 gm day-1) but was the lowest survival rate (75%) followed by 30% protein content feed of Trt.-II. 28% protein content feed Diet (Trt.-III) without animal protein was the poorest growth rate (0.039 g day-1) with highest survival rate (90%) among the tasted feed. It was observed that feed with higher protein level was better for the fish growth and the growth of fish was different significantly among the treatment except the treatment fish meal+ Groundnut cake+ rice bran + wheat flour and commercial cattle feed. Thus animal protein containing artificial feed, on the basis of growth performance can be induced in the feed formulation of fry of common carp
