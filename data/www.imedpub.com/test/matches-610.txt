MHD peristaltic transport of a micropolar fluid in an asymmetric channel with porous medium
In the present study the peristaltic transport of an incompressible conducting micropolar fluid in an asymmetric channel with porous medium has been studied under the assumptions of long wave length and low Reynolds number. Applying wave frame analysis, exact analytical solutions have been obtained for the axial velocity and the microrotation component. Expression for the pressure rise is also obtained. The influence of physical parameters on the velocity, pressure gradient and pressure rise are presented through graphs. The effect of increase in the permeability parameter and the magnetic parameter is to reduce the velocity.
