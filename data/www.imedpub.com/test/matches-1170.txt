Preparation, identification and antimicrobial studies of some bimetallic bridged thiocyanates complexes containing N,N'-bis (4-isopropyl benzylidene) 4-methyl benzene -1,2-diamine Schiff base ligand
New Schiff base ligand (L) was prepared from reaction of 4-isopropyl benzaldehyde with 4-methyl benzene -1,2- diamine.This ligand was treated with tetrathiocyanate complexes of MM'(SCN)4 [M = Co(II) , Ni(II) , Hg(II) ; M' = Cd(II)] to form three new complexes. These compounds have been characterized by different analytical and spectral techniques like elemental analysis, infrared, ultraviolet-visible, 1H, 13C-NMR, mass spectra, molar conductance, atomic absorption and magnetic susceptibility studies. All the complexes are binuclear mixed metal monomeric bridged of the type LM(NCS)2M'(SCN)2, non electrolytes and have coordination number equal four .Some thermal parameters of the prepared complexes was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) . It was observed that these complexes have a good thermal stability. Antibacterial and antifungal activity of the ligand and its complexes were evaluated. They have significant antimicrobial activity
