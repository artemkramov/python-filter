Physico-chemical analysis of upper lake water in Bhopal region of Madhya Pradesh, India
Lake water samples were collected from thirteen (15) locations during pre and post monsoon season. The physicochemical parameters such as pH, Total hardness, Ca hardness, Mg hardness, Ca content, Mg content, Chloride, BOD and COD were analyzed to know the present status of the lakewater quality. Lake water quality of premonsoon season was better than post monsoon season. The upper lake water requires appropriate water treatment measures prior to be used for drinking purpose
