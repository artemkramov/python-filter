Baleria opaca: Its phytochemical evaluation, antibacterial and antifungal properties
The preliminary phytochemical studies of Baleria opaca (whole plant) extracts revealed the presence of saponins, tannins, glycosides, alkaloids and anthraquinones, but absence of reducing sugars and flavonoids. Hexane, ethylacetate and methanol successive extracts of Baleria opaca effectively inhibited the growth of six test bacteria and six test fungi at different concentrations. The Methanol extract exhibited higher antibacterial properties than both hexane and ethylacetate extracts on Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis (gram positive), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonellae typhii and Klebsiellae pneumonae (gram negative). All the extracts also exhibited significant antifungal properties on Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolon, penicillum notatum, Tricophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum at concentrations between 25 and 200 mg/ml.
