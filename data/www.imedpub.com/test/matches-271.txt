Potentials of Biosurfactant Producing Pseudomonas sp from automobile workshop
In the present study soil sample from automobile workshop located at Gandhigram, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India was collected, serially diluted and the dilutions 10-5 and 10-6 were plated on to nutrient agar plates. The predominant colony was selected, identified by Biochemical tests. Then the isolated culture was mass multiplied in mineral salt medium by adding carbon sources such as sunflower oil and whey individually for the production of biosurfactant compounds. The produced product was extracted by acetone precipitation method. After extraction it was analysed physically, chemically and the product thus extracted was identified as biosurfactant compounds Rhamnolipid. Further emulsification index of rhamnolipid was calculated by the ability of biosurfactant compound to emulsify carbon sources like diesel oil, petrol and kerosene. The study concludes that the biosurfactant compound produced by Peudomonas sp was rhamnolipid which is having a higher emulsifying index of 50 with both sunflower oil and whey as carbon sources.
