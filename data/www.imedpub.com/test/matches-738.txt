Effects of CuO/Zn Nanoparticles in Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals.
PVA based CuO/Zn nanoparticles doped liquid crystals are formed by solvent induced phase separation method (SIPS). Structural, electrical and optical characterization of inorganic nanoparticles doped PDLC are studied. The presence of liquid crystal and nanoparticles in PVA Matrix were conformed and the modified properties of PDLC due to doped nanoparticle were studied and explained by the results of FTIR, SEM, UV, TG/DTA dielectric measurement, Conductivity measurement, and the Cole Cole plot. Incorporation of nano particles modifies the structure of PDLC and thus it makes increase in the amount of droplets and decrease in droplet size, as well as improves the electrical conductivity.
