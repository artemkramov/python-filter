Use of Kota stone waste to ameliorate the soil fertility and to alleviate environmental hazards
Rajasthan is characterized as the home to inexhaustible sources of various types of dimensional stones which include marble, granite, lime stone and Kota stone. Kota stone industry is one of the well-known industries of Rajasthan. The increasing demand of Kota stone in various purposes has led to the generation of large amount of waste during mechanical processing in the form of slurry and solid waste. Improper waste disposal has caused land degradation, loss of aesthetics, pollution, health and safety hazards consequently recycling of industrial wastes and by products is becoming a crucial demand by the environmental laws in agreement with the concept of sustainable development. Kota stone waste contains many organic and inorganic materials which can be transformed into certain useful, valuable and more accessible forms. The chemical analysis of Kota stone waste was carried out through XRF. This analysis reveals the presence of certain micro, macro and ultra-micro nutrients which can be of great potential as soil amendment and may be beneficial for the proper growth of the plants.
