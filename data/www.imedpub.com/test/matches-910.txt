Antimalarial drug resistance malaria parasite: A review in NE states of India
The eight Northeastern (NE) states sharing a significant proportion of malaria cases reported in every year from India. Nowadays, several classes of antimalarial drugs like chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, combination drugs artemisinin plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine etc. are used for treatment of malaria cases. In NE states, several research works are going on at molecular level for evaluation of new and effective antimalarial drugs. However, the major malaria parasite (P. falciparum) circulating in NE states has developed resistance to all the currently used antimalarial except recently introduced artemether–lumefantrine combination. Keeping in mind, the review study aims to highlight the current research works related to the scenario of antimalarial drug resistance P. falciparum parasite circulating in NE states, distribution of haplotypes and their diversity, vector incrimination etc
