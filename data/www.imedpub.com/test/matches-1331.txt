Physico-chemical characterization and water quality index of ground water of Dhanbad town area
In this study an attempt has been made to understand the ground water quality of Dhanbad town area in Jharkhand state, India by Physico- chemical characterization and water quality index. For this purpose grab samples were collected from different hand pumps of the Dhanbad town area during the month of December 2012 as per standard method of sampling and analyzed for their physicochemical characteristics. The value of various physicochemical parameters such as Total hardness, Total dissolved solid (TDS), Chloride, Conductivity, Salinity, Total suspended solid (TSS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Calcium hardness, Magnesium hardness, Alkalinity and Sulphate have been found to be 1700 mg/l, 966 mg/l, 908.8 mg/l, 1790 μS/cm, 1455 mg/l, 6.9 524 mg/l, 1207.5 mg/l, 173 mg/l , 372 mg/l and 0.674 mg/l respectively. The results shows that 75% of the water samples falls in the category B (Good water) and 25% of the water sample falls in the category C (Poor water) which is mainly due to high TDS and total hardness
