Studies on X Ã¢ÂÂ doped (X = Al, Zn and Cu) and undoped Lead Iodide single crystals relating to XRD
X – doped (X = Al, Zn and Cu) and undoped Lead Iodide crystals were grown by gel technique by single diffusion method. After the complete growth of X – doped and undoped Lead Iodide crystals in test tube, they were taken out carefully from the test tube.Then, they are washed with acetone and dried for whole night under light. Then, they are crushed in a size of 150 mesh. Asgrown crystals were subjected to XRD, lattice parameters, hkl plane and structure compared and reported.
