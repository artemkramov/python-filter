Exploring the ability of Streptomyces antibiotics to combat Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus using insilico studies
Human Pathogens such as Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] are becoming notorious as they confound the tools that are used to treat them. This owes to the enormous potential of these dreadful pathogens to combat against most of the available antibiotics. This raises the need for the discovery and development of novel antimicrobials that have the ability to demolish MRSA. The present study focuses on the exploration of antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces antibiotics to combat MRSA using docking studies. The Streptomyces antibiotic, Polymyxin B is found to have the potency of inhibiting the pathogen on acting upon a particular drug target. Thus the findings from the study can pave a novel way to treat the fatal pathogen.
