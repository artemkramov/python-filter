Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles from leaves extract of ethnomedicinal plants- Pogostemon benghalensis (B) O.Ktz.
The byproducts obtain from to synthesis nanomaterials by using physical and chemical methods are toxic, environmentally hazardous and above all the whole procedures are costly. For alternative, either using micro organisms or using plant extract methods environment friendly biosynthesis methods are chosen at present to synthesis nano-materials. In the present study, silver nano-particles are synthesized from local traditional medicinal plant- Pogostemon benghalensis (B) O.Ktz. (Assamese vernacular name-shukloti). As preliminary investigations, formations of silver nano-particles are confirmed from their optical properties by UV-VIS spectroscopy and EDX.Synthesised particles are characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and SEM
