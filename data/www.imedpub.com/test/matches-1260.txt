Ichthyo faunal bio diversity in the lower Manair Dam at Karimnagar district; Telangana State: India
Pisces, faunal bio diversity in the Lower Manair Dam was studied from June-2013 to May-2014. Samples were collected bimonthly with help of local fishermen by using fishing Craft and Gear. A total of 64 species of fishes belonging to 8 orders such as Cypriniformes (27 species) Siluriformes (13species), Perciformes (14 species), Channiformes (4 species) Beloniformes(2 species), Angulliformes (2 species) Osteoglossiformes (one species) and Mogiliformes(one species). The number and percentage composition of population status were calculated to 32.81% common, 29.69% abundant, 21.86% moderate, and 15.63% rare species were identified in the Lower Manair Dam. Of these, 52 species of fish are least concerned (LC), 4 are data deficient (DD), 2 are not evaluate (NE), 2 species of fish were endangered (ED) and 1 species of fish is vulnerable (VU). IUCN (2004.2), CAMP (1998) status and Shannon-Weiner diversity (H-), Evenness (E), Hmax = ln(S) Maximum diversity possible and species richness (S) for different months were calculated
