Evaluation of monthly total global and diffuse solar radiation in Ibi, Taraba state, Nigeria
This study utilized monthly average daily values of global solar radiation and sunshine hour for Ibi, Taraba State, North-Eastern Nigeria to assess the applicability of solar energy utilization for this area. The clearness index KT values indicate the clear sky in the months of February to July and October to December for Ibi (lat.8.110N). The result obtained shows the variation of direct and diffuse component of solar radiation in summer and winter months. In this area the diffuse radiations is maximum during the month of July and August and minimum during the months of November, December and January.
