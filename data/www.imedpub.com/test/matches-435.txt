Thermal diffusion and radiation effects on unsteady mhd flow, through porous medium with variable temperature and mass diffusion in the presence of heat source/sink
The objective of the present study is to investigate thermal diffusion and radiation effects on unsteady MHD flow past an impulsively started infinite vertical plate with variable temperature and mass diffusion in the presence of heat source or sink through porous medium. The fluid considered here is a gray, absorbing/ emitting radiation but a non-scattering medium. At time t&gt;0, the plate is given an impulsive motion with a velocityu = u0 in the vertical upward direction against to the gravitational field. And at the same time, the plate temperature and concentration levels near the plate raised linearly with time t. The dimensionless governing equations involved in the present analysis are solved using the Laplace transform technique. The velocity, temperature, concentration, Skin-friction, the rate or heat transfer and the rate of mass transfer are studied through graphs and tables in terms of different physical parameters entering into the problem.
