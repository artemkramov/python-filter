Common fixed point theorems for four self maps on a fuzzy metric space,satisfying common E. A. property
In this paper, we prove common fixed point theorems for four self maps by using weak compatibility in fuzzy metric spaces. Our result extend, generalized several fixed point theorems on metric and fuzzy metric spaces.
