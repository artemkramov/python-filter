An assessment of Plankton diversity and abundance of Arkavathi River with reference to pollution
Plankton diversity and abundance of Arkavathi river was assessed before and after pollution. Plankton diversity and abundance varied during different seasons, both at non-polluted and polluted sites. A total of 71 species of phytoplanktons and 27 species of zooplanktons were recorded. Myxophycean species were found to be dominant at both the stations. Euglenophyceae have shown less number of phytoplanktons abundance in both the sites. The studies have revealed that polluted water shows relatively grater abundance of Myxophyceae and zooplanktons as compared to the non-polluted water. Nutrient enrichment of the river due to silk industries effluents has altered the structure of plankton community
