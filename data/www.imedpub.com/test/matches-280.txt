Effects of boiling time on the concentrations of vitamin c and beta-carotene in five selected green vegetables consumed in Ghana
This study was carried out to determine the effects of boiling on the nutritional composition of selected green vegetables consumed in Ghana. Five green vegetables Cabbage (Brassica oleracea), Ayoyo (Corchorus olitorius), Okro (Abelmoschus esculentus), Abeduru (Solanum torvum) and Nkontomire (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) were selected. The samples were taken from farms around University of Cape Coast in the Cape Coast Municipality in the Central Region of Ghana. Equal weights of the vegetables were boiled at different boiling times (5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes). The boiled samples were then analyzed for the effect of boiling time on the vitamin C and beta-carotene concentration. The results of the study revealed that as the boiling time increased, the concentration of betacarotene and vitamin C in the vegetables decreased. Also the reduction in the vitamin C concentration was found to be greater in the vegetables than the reduction in the beta-carotene concentration. It is therefore suggested that boiling of vegetables should be done within the shortest possible time to retain most of these nutrients
