Nutritional composition of wild edible ceropegia tubers
A nutritive value of two members of Asclepiadaceae has been investigated. In the study botanical characteristic of some wild edible plants, consumed abundantly in the region, such as Ceropegia hirsuta, Ceropegia bulbosa, were performed in order to determine nutritive values of these plants. In the study, dry matter, ash, protein, nitrogen, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn and Vit C contents in the dried plant samples were evaluated. Nutritive values of these plants were compared with the other conventional vegetables. As a result mineral contents and nutritional values of the plants evaluated in the present study were richer than that of the conventional vegetable crops. The results revealed that the tubers were contains moisture with in range of (75.82-78.24%fw), dry matter (21.76-24.18% fw),crude protein (4.62-4.82g/100g dw),ash (10.2- 10.6%dw),crude fat(0.1-0.11%dw),crude fiber (8.7-9.1%dw) reducing sugar (1.727-1.948g/100g dw), total sugar (1.840-2.138g/100g dw) and Starch (14.23-15.46g/100g dw). The tubers also have a high energy value (256.14-286.14kcal/100g dw). Mineral ranges (mg/100g dw)were:K(400-440), Na(10.42- 12.32), P(150-155), Ca(428-437.2), Mg(148.36-152.48), Cu(0.83-0.89), Fe(45.6-49.04), Mn(3.31-3.33) and Zn(1.22-1.5). Comparing the tubers contents with recommanded dietary allowances (RDA), the results indicated that tubers of asclepiadaceae member could be a good supplement for some nutrients such as fiber, protein and carbohydrates
