Study of Ultrasonic Velocity of Acrylates with Decane-2-ol
Thermodynamic data involving ultrasonic velocities of binary liquid mixtures of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate with decane-2-ol have been measured at 298.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. Experimental values of ultrasonic velocities were correlated with Jouyban-Acree model. Deviations in isentropic compressibility were calculated and have been fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. Ultrasonic velocities were also calculated theoretically using various theories such as Nomoto, Van Dael, free length theory and collision factor theory. Excess parameters like specific acoustic impendence, intermolecular free length, available volume, intrinsic pressure, molecular association and molar sound velocity were also calculated. Graphical representations of these excess derived thermodynamic parameters used to explain type and extent of intermolecular interactions.
