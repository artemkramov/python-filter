Effect of substrate temperature on structural and optical properties of thermally evaporated thin films of F16CuPc
Effect of substrate temperature on optical and structural properties of thin films of Hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F16CuPc) has been studied. Thin films of F16CuPc were deposited onto glass substrates using thermal evaporation technique at different substrates temperatures. Structural characterization has been carried using XRD analysis. Average grain size has been found to be increasing with increasing substrate temperature. Optical characterization has been carried out using the absorption spectra, at normal incidence, in range 200-900 nm. Absorption and extinction coefficients of the films so obtained has been evaluated. Both of these have been observed to vary with wavelength. The values of extinction coefficients have been found to decrease with increasing substrate temperature whereas increase in Optical band gap energy, for direct allowed transitions, with increasing substrate temperature has been noticed
