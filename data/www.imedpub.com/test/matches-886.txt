3-(2-oxo-2-Phenylethylidene)-1-((1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl) methyl)indolin-2-ones: Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity
The novel 3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethylidene)-1-((1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)indolin-2-one derivatives were synthesized from Cu-catalyzed [3+2] cyclo addition reaction of alkyne with various aryl azides. The synthesized 1,2,3-triazoles were characterized by IR, 1HNMR and Mass spectral techniques and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. Compounds 3a, 3d, 3f, 3h and 3i showed significant antibacterial activity when compared to standard drug Streptomycin
