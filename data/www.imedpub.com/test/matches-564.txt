Richarson-schottky emission in Hypertemperature in PbPc and CuPc thin films
The thin film of Lead Phthalocyanine (PbPc) and Cupper Phthalocyanine (CuPc) on glass are prepared by Vacuum deposition method. Deposition of PbPc and CuPc on pre-cleaned glass substrates under the pressure of 10-6 Torr are achieved by slowly varying the current. The rate of evaporation is properly controlled and maintained constant during all the evaporations. The thicknesses of the films are 150 nm, 300 nm and 450 nm on glass substrate. Current voltage conduction properties of Lead Phthalocyanine and Cupper Phthalocyanine thin films have been studied. At the higher temperatures, the slope of I –V curves indicates that the thermally generated carrier density exceeds that of the injected charges. In the case, it is observed that the slope of log (J) vs log (V) curves is about unity for 300 K. The region is considered as ohmic. The plots of In (J/T) versus 1000/ T at different voltages tend to be straight lines at higher temperatures. The straight line behaviour occurs at above 325 K. However the domination of the thermionic emission behaviour is observed at higher temperatures
