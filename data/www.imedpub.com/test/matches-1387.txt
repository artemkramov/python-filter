Sorption dynamics of reactive and direct dyes onto activated carbon derived from ipomoea carnea stem waste
Activated carbon materials were prepared from abundantly available Ipomoea Carnea stem waste. A series of carbon samples were prepared by subjecting the carbon material to various chemical processes. These materials accumulate superior properties and good adsorption behaviours. The adsorption capacity of selected derived carbon sample using Ipomoea Carnea stem waste prepared by Dolomite process was much greater than the capacities of the other carbons prepared by various processes. The adsorption of Reactive Blue 4 (Reactive dye) and Direct Red 28( Direct dye) on this dolomite treated activated carbon was investigated to assess the possible use of this adsorbent for the processing of dyeing industry wastewater. The influence of various factors such as initial dye concentration, agitation time and Particle size on the adsorption capacity has been studied. The percentage removal of dye is observed to decrease with the increase in initial dye concentration..The adsorption of dye also decreases with increase in Particle size. Kinetic data have been studied using Pseudo-first order and Pseudo-second order equations for understanding the reaction mechanism.
