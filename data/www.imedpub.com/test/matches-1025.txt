The effect of jump-rope training on the physical fitness of 9 to 10 years old female students
The main aim of this study is to find the effect of jump-rope training on the physical fitness of 9 to 10 years old female students. Considering the mentioned objective, 20 volunteered female students of Jahrom are selected as cases for this study and they are randomly divided into training group and controlling group. The first group, participated in jump-rope training three sessions per week. This training process continued 15 weeks, while; the latter group did not participate in any exercise programs and continued with their daily activities. Some factors related to the physical fitness, such as balance, speed, and agility of the participants are assessed before and after the training process. Data analysis is performed by using dependent and independent t-test. The results have demonstrated that the balance, agility, and power of the training group is increased (p&lt;0.05), however; similar results are not achieved for speed (p&gt;0.05). The results have proven that jump-rope training increases the physical fitness of 9 to 10 years old female students. However, speed seem to be a heritable trait and did not change after the training process.
