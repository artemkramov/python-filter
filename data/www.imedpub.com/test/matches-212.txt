Evaluation of antifungal activity of Zingiber officinale against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici
Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has long been used as naturopathy due to its potential antimicrobial activity against different pathogens. This study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of dried ginger powder, using paper disc diffusion assay, by using chloroform, ethanol, acetone and petroleum ether solvents, against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. The present study showed the potent antimicrobial activity of the ginger extract against the pathogen by all tested solvents. Chloroform extract of ginger at its 750 mg/ml concentration showed highest zone of inhibition as 25.75 mm against tested pathogen. Whereas, other solvents showed moderate to minimum antifungal activity. These findings suggests that some plant extracts tested possess antifungal activities against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici.
