Quantitative determination of Efavirenz in bulk drug and formulation by colorimetry
A simple fast and reproducible spectrophotometric method has been developed for the determination of Efavirenz in pure and tablet dosage forms using  - naphthol reagent. The method is based on the reaction of Efavirenz with sodium nitrite and HCl, form N – nitroso compound, which react with  – naphthol and measuring the resulting low colour complex at 561nm under the prepared optimum conditions. Beer’s law was obeyed at the concentration range of 10-20/. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines by performing linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of quantification, limit of detection and selectivity. The recovery study was carried out by standard method and good results were obtained for Efavir and Sustiva.
