Study of the research octane number depression of domestic kerosene-doped automotive gasoline
All engines are manufactured to run on specific gasoline, the engine problems will occur if the gasoline specifications is changed. When kerosene or diesel are added to various types of automotive gasoline, the octane rating quality will fall below the octane requirements of engine and therefore engine knocking can occur. knocking is a spontaneous and extremely rapid ignition of the gasoline-air mixture in the combustion chamber . The concurrent sudden build-up of high heat and pressure, far beyond that of normal combustion, creates a shock wave which is heard as a ping or a knock and causes damage to the engine and reduce the engine efficiency. A number of analytical techniques are available to detect gasoline adulteration as flash point, refractive index and density. But in this research, the effect of adding domestic kerosene to automotive gasoline on the research octane number rating was accurately studied and investigated to see the magnitude of an octane number depression then the research octane number calibration curves were constructed to detect some suspected samples of automotive gasoline that were collected from different stations in Jordan
