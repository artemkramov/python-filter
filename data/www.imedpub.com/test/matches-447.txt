K-feldspar megacrysts in Uwet Granodiorite: Ã¢ÂÂlate stageÃ¢ÂÂ crystals?
The “Uwet Granodiorite” is a term referring to Pan-African granitoids (granodiorites) occurring in the Uwet area – Oban massif, SE Nigeria (8o 00’ – 8o 30’E and 5 o 00’ – 5 o 30’N). These rocks were emplaced by magmatic stoping and assimilation, and possible products of the mixing of more than one magma series and or contamination. Several authors have proposed suggestions on the processes and timing of megacrysts formation in granitoids. Structural, petrographical and chemical studies from this work strongly favour a magmatic/phenocrystic origin for the K-feldspar megacrysts in Uwet granodiorite. These evidences also show that the phenocrysts were formed at liquidus temperature in the presence of abundant liquid. These results agree with similar studies from other parts of the world.
