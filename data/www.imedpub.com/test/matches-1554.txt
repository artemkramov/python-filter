Determination of natural radiation contamination for some types of legumes available in the Iraqi markets
In this research, the Uranium (U-238), Thorium (Th-232) and Potassium (K-40) with the specific activity (10) in some types of legumes that are available in the Iraqi market samples had been measured and the internal hazard index, radium equivalent and the annual effective dose of K-40 in all samples were determined. The gamma spectrometry method with a NaI(Tl) detector was used for radiometric measurements. It was found that the specific activity in legumes varied from 1.450±0.096 to 12.307±0.387 Bq/kg (average of 7.475 Bq/kg) for U-238, from 0.371±0.058 to 9.289±0.465 Bq/kg (average of 3.79941 Bq/kg) for Th-232, and from 64.096±1.037 to 603.397±8.757 Bq/kg ( average 385.2477 Bq/kg) for K-40. The results were compared with international recommended values and were found to be within the international level.
