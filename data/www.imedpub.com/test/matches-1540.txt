Seed-mediated growth of palladium nanocrystals on ITO substrate and their characterization
In recent years, the seed-mediated growth method has been suggested as a new strategy to attach and grow metal nanoparticles on conducting substrates, such as indium tin oxide (ITO). In this method, Palladium nanoparticles can be fixed via a simple two-step immersion of the substrate into two different solutions at room temperature. In the first step, the nano-seed particles are inferred to attach on the surfaces by just immersing the substrates into the metal colloid solution (the seed solution) via the physi-sorption. In the second step, gradual nanocrystal growth from the nano-seed particles attached on the substrate is considered to occur via the chemical reduction of metal ions in the solution containing surfactants (the growth solution). After the growth treatment for 24 hr, PdNPs grew up to 60-80 nm, exhibiting crystal-like appearances. Thus prepared PdNPs tend to stick each other, so that the dense gathering of PdNPs was observed on the ITO surfaces. In present study, some details of our preparation methods of palladium nanoparticle-attached ITO electrodes, optical and electrochemical behaviour, other characterization like AFM, SEM, XRD of thus fabricated materials are summarized
