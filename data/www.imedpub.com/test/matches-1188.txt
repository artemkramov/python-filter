Efficacy of crude extracts of Allium sativum and Allium cepa against human pathogens
Onion and garlic are best known for their pungent aromas, but these potent veggies have powerful effects on health and also there is urgent need to identify superior populations, quickly characterize and select elite candidates and breed new varieties for achieving current as well as future food and global health security needs. Hence this study is focused on the analysis of the biological activity of Allium cepa from Surandai, Alankulam and Vilathikulam and Allium sativum from Poomparai, Vadugapatti and Pannaikadu. Based on the antimicrobial activity of onion, onion from Vilathikulam was determined as the best germplasm since it showed best result towards the bacterial organisms and garlic from Pannaikadu showed best result in antimicrobial analysis revealed that this particular germplasm was best.
