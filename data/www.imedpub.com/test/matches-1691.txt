Structural, morphological and optical studies of ZnSe thin films: Growth using chemical bath
Wide bandgap ZnSe (Eg=2.7 eV) films were grown under increasing influence of reducing atmosphere with 70 0C growth temperature, 210 min deposition time and pH equal to 10±0.2. The concentration of hydrazine hydrate in the bath was therefore varied and film stoichiometry (Zn/Se ratio) was determined from the EDS observations on the films (0.993 to 0.570). All the films exhibited wurtzite structure with preferred &lt;101&gt; orientation. AFM (3D) images showed that the surface roughness varied from 0.451 μm to 0.155 μm as Zn/Se ratio decreased. The reflectance spectra gave decrease in the band gap (2.69 eV to 2.55 eV) with decrease in Zn/Se ratio
