Improved electrical response of MIS diode with disperse orange-25 as insulator deposited by centrifugal process
Disperse Orange-25 (OD-25), 3-[Ethyl[4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo]phenyl]amino]-propanenitrile),has recently emerged as novel organic semiconductor form any electronics and optoelectronic devices. Here we investigate the electrical response of Silver/Orange-25 /Silicon (Ag/OD-25/Si) as Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) diode, where OD- 25thin-film was deposited by centrifugal process. We report different diode parameters such as series resistance, ideality factor, and density of interfacial state and interfacial barrier height as a function of processing parameter gravity acceleration. We find that high gravity acceleration improves the overall diode parameters, while the diode fabricated at 277g offers the most improved electrical response. Such improvement in diode parameters at gravity acceleration 277g is due to the formation of high quality OD-25interfacial layer for MIS diode.
