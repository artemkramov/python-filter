Environmental sanitation comprises disposal and treatment of human excreta, solid waste and wastewater, control of disease vectors, and provision of washing facilities for personal and domestic hygiene. This paper analyzes the availability of water and sanitation in Solapur slum with the help of validated questionnaire for data collection .The result of study indicates that environmental sanitation through inhabitants is of an average degree, but not very much satisfactory from the hygiene point of view. Lack of water and poor sanitation is one of the many challenges faced by poor urban populations. The conventional approach to environmental sanitation is characterized by a linear waste management system; where organic materials are create pollution problems in receiving waters thereby posing health risks to the local populace. The study finds a relationship between the socioeconomic status and the availability of water and sanitation
