Evaluation of dried marine sludge-based ceramic tiles by using spectroscopy techniques
In this study, various proportions of tile making powder (masse) were replaced with marine sludge to manufacture ceramic tile specimens. This work describes the changes in the behavior of the masse (material) used in a ceramic industry due to addition of a marine sludge, produced in a ceramic tile processing industry in Cuddalore District, Tamilnadu, India. Compositional evaluation was assessed by XRD, SEM-EDX and FT-IR spectroscopy and the presence of impurities in the marine sludge induces changes on functional properties (e. g. refractoriness). However, those variations are easily predicted and can be accounted for.
