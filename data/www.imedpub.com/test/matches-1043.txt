Colorless sulfur oxidizing bacteria from diverse habitats
Colorless sulfur oxidizing bacteria comprise an important part of sulfur cycle in nature and hold significant value for biotechnological applications such as, increasing soil fertility, reduction of environmental pollution by biologically oxidizing toxic sulfides present in waste waters from different industries and sewage, leaching of economically important metals from poor ores. Present article reviews diversity of aerobic sulfur oxidizing bacteria in different habitats and some of their applications
