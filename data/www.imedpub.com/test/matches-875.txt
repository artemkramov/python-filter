Applicability of Length Biased Weighted Generalized Rayleigh Distribution
The length-biased form of the Weighted Generalized Rayleigh distribution (WGRD) known as length-biased Weighted Generalized Rayleigh distribution is considered. From the length-biased WGRD, well known distributions are generated by expanding suitable functions of the parameters. Properties of length-biased WGRD are discussed. The parameters of the lengthbiased WGRD are obtained by the method of moments and fitted accordingly.
