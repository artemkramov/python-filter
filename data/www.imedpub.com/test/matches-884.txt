Occurence and species diversity of kola weevils across different ecological zones of Southwestern Nigeria
Kola weevil species were surveyed in different ecological zones of South-western Nigeria and the adult kola weevils together with their progenies were monitored and assessed in the laboratory at ambient temperature of 27+20C and relative humidity of 70+5% using Completely Randomised Design in four replicates. The fresh nuts were allowed to dry on a wire mesh before they were wrapped in plantain leaves prior to storage in baskets. Data were collected on damage characteristics at 30 days interval. The result showed that Balanogastris kolae were significantly higher in mean number of exit holes (71.37), weight of frass (10.13) and nut damage (80.14) compared to Sophrorhinus spp. The higher number of B. kolae (63.54) observed relatively to few Sophrorhinus spp indicates abundance of B. kolae in Nigeria. These insect pests are implicated as field-to-store pests and are widely distributed across the kola growing belt of Southern Nigeria
