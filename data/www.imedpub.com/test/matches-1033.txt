Z = (z - t ) Type plane gravitational wave with domain wall in bimetric relativity
In this paper, Z = (z - t ) plane gravitational wave is studied with the matter domain wall in the framework of Rosen’s Bimetric theory of gravitation and observed that the domain wall does not exist in this theory. And further, we discussed some of the physical and kinematical properties of the models
