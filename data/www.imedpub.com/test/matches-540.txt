Bacteriorhodopsin as a nanomemory
Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is produced by halobacteria and is the key protein of their photosynthetic capabilities. Rather soon after its discovery, the first proposals for technical applications of this protein were brought up. Various technical and in particular optical applications of BR have been explored since that time in several research groups. In this paper, the area of photochromic applications of BR is reviewed. BR is so attractive over other proteins and conventional inorganic or organic photochromic materials. BR not only is an attractive candidate to be the first photochromic biomolecule in a technical application but also allow exploration of strategies how biomaterials with technically interesting physical functions can be used as components in technical devices
