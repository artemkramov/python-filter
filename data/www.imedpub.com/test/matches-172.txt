The effect of delignification on the saccharification of abakaliki rice husk
Limited world reserves of petroleum have generated great interest in the development of hydrolytic processes for the production of fuels and chemical feedstock from renewable resources. Renewable cellulosic material especially agricultural residues rich in cellulose are one of the most abundant biomass on earth. Due to the uncoordinated channel of waste disposal, these agricultural waste residues such as rice husks, undergo uncontrolled fermentation and putrification where they are dumped, thereby constituting environmental pollution and health hazards. This work is therefore carried out to help reduce the problems caused by the waste disposal. Delignification was carried out using varying concentrations of sodium hydroxide and maximum delignification of 80.41% was achieved using 12% (w/v) sodium hydroxide, which was hydrolysed at 303K for 45 minutes and 83.13% of reducing sugar was obtained. The experiments carried out, demonstrate that delignification is essential for saccharification.
