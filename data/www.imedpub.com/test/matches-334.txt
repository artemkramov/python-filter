Flyash: Characteristics, Problems and Possible Utilization
Flyash, the after-burnt tiny coal dust is a byproduct from the thermal power plants, is a alumino-silicate non-reactive inert particle which may remain suspended in the air from few seconds to several months. Till now, the major source of power in India comes from burning of low-quality coal, and the country needs more power every day. In this situation, the evaluation of this ecologically sensitive toxic substance has been assessed in this article in terms of its origin, nature, properties, environmental distribution, impact and possible biological and non-biological utilization-modes to draw the deep attention of the environment research explorers.
