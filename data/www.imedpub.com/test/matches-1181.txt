Surface water (Futala Lake) quality and its pollution load in terms of water quality index (WQI)
The present work aims at assessing the water quality index (WQI) in the surface water (Futala lake) situated in Nagpur City, Maharashtra India, by monitoring five sampling locations within Futala lake (viz., inlet1, inlet2, centre, corner and outlet) for a period of 3 months from August to October 2013. The surface water samples were subjected to comprehensive physico-chemical analysis involving major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Fe2+,), anions ( Cl-, SO4 2-, NO3 -, F-, PO4 3-) besides general parameters (pH, EC, TDS, alkalinity, total hardness, DO, BOD, COD). For calculating the WQI, 14 parameters, namely, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, fluorides and iron were considered. It is apparent from WQI values that Futala Lake water with WQI values ranging from 55.81 to 169.37, falls under poor water category. The present study revealed that Futala lake water is polluted (due to surface run-off, washing activities, agriculture run-off, effluents from upstream from surrounding residential area, immersion of idols of God and Goddess during festival season, discharge of domestic sewage (poor) and dumping of garbage) and unsuitable for human consumption also for the survival of life forms unless treated properly. There is need for implementing conservation measures and generating awareness among the people towards the lake which provides livelihood to the people and forms an integral part of the social, economic and cultural life.
