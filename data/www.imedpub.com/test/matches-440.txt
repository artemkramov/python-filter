Comparative study on antioxidant activity of different species of Solanaceae family
Antioxidant activity of the ethyl acetate extract of Solanum anguivi Lam., was compared with that of Solanum pubescence Willd, Solanum torvum Swartz, Solanum trilobatum Linn. Solanum nigrum Linn. and Solanum surratense Burm.F., and was determined by use of 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydryzyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The higher the concentration of the extract gave higher free radical scavenging activity. Antioxidant activity of the plant extracts decreased in the order: S. anguivi&gt; S. pubscense&gt; S. torvum&gt; S. trilobatum &gt; S. nigrum&gt; S. surratense. The antioxidant potential of the S. anguivi extract were assessed by employing different in vitro assays such as FTC, TBA, HRSA, PMA, Metal chelating assay and super oxide anion radical scavenging capacity. The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the antioxidant properties of six different plant’s ethyl acetate extracts of solanaceae family. Strong inhibitions of free radicals were caused by the ethyl acetate extract of S. anguivi. Thus, S. anguivi could be considered as a potential source of natural antioxidants.
