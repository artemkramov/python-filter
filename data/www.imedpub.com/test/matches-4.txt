Spectral, thermal investigations and particle size determination of L-threonine single crystals
Single crystals of L- threonine (L-thr) were grown successfully by slow-evaporation technique. The as grown crystals were subjected to various characterization like powder XRD, FT-IR recordings. The structure of the crystal was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The UV-Vis-NIR spectrum and second harmonic generation were investigated to study the linear and nonlinear optical properties In order to ascertain the thermal stability of the crystal, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA) were also carried out. The second harmonic generation conversion efficiency of the grown crystal shows the suitability for frequency conversion applications. Structural parameters were also calculated which has been reported for the first time
