Effect of chemical reaction, radiation and radiation absorption on the unsteady convective heat and mass transfer flow of a viscous fluid in a vertical wavy channel with oscillatory flux and heat sources
We analyze the effect of chemical reaction, radiation, and radiation absorption on the transient convective heat and mass transfer flow of a viscous, electrically conducting fluid in a vertical wavy channel with oscillatory flux. The equations governing the flow, heat and mass transfer are solved by a regular perturbation technique with the slope δ as a perturbation parameter. The velocity, temperature, concentration, the rate of heat and mass transfer are analyzed for different variations of the governing parameters α, Q1, N1, β and K.
