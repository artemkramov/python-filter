Assessment of salinity tolerance of different promising lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
Evaluation of 342 synthetic lines of bread wheat with three ones of control (Arg, Bam, Kavir) at salinity and normal conditions was carried out during the 2009-2010 in Iran. Salt tolerance indices including: Stress Tolerance Index (STI), Stress Susceptibility Index (SSI), Tolerance Index (TOL), Mean Productivity (MP) and Geometric Mean Productivity (GMP) were calculated. Result of tolerance indices showed that GMP and STI indices were appropriate indices to identify tolerant lines in salinity stress. On the basis of these indices, 12 lines including (10, 32, 74, 86, 92, 98,114, 191,188, 297, 300, 326) were identified as the most tolerance lines. There were significant differences among evaluated lines and control lines for seed yield. The highest values for seed yield were observed in Arg and lines number of 5, 10, 32, 74, 95, 86, 98,115,117, 120, 118, 143,147,149,152, 176, 216,223, 225, 301,313 and 358 in saline condition. This study showed that salinity stress had significant effect on seed yield reduction of some genotypes. Therefore, selection of salt tolerance genotypes with consideration of their indices (e.g. GMP and STI) could be a good strategy for improvement of salt tolerance genotypes in bread wheat. It could be resulted that synthetic lines of 10, 32, 74, 86, 92,98, 114,188, 191, 297,300, 326 that had more seed yield than control varieties of Arg, Bam and Kavir, were identified as the promising lines for wheat breeding programs.
