Bioaccumulation of some heavy metals in different tissues of commercial fish Lethrinus lentjan from Chinnamuttom Coastal area, Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu
Concentration of zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) were determined in muscles, liver and gills of the marine fish species Lethrinus lentjan from Chinnamuttom coast, southern tip of Kanyakumari during February 2010- January 2011 to understand the toxicity of heavy metals. The results were expressed as μg/gm dry weight of tissue. The concentration of zinc varied from 3.71 – 8.35, 26.18 – 27.38 and 9.03 to 10.78, iron content fluctuated from 25.62 – 27.68, 26.13 – 27.63 and 10.65 – 12.95 and the copper content varied from 1.63– 2.97, 4.1 – 7.25 and 2.16 – 2.97μg/gm dry weight of tissue in muscles, liver and gills respectively. A positive correlation were observed between the selected metals in muscles and gills whereas negative correlation were observed between zinc and copper (r = -0.476) and iron and copper (r = - 0.144) in liver of Lethrinus lentjan. Heavy metals in the different tissues of Lethrinus lentjan were in the permissible safety levels for human uses.
