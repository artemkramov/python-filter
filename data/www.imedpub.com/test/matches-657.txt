The turbidity of water was measured from the month of June 2010 to May 2011.The study was made for one year duration to know the pollution and turbidity of water loaded in this region. During the course of investigation the dam is heavily infested with the different aquatic weeds like Pistia, Chara, Nitella, Vallisneria, Cyprus, Hydrilla, Wolffia, Lemna, etc. Not only this it is infested with the many algal members like Diatoms,Navicula,Cosmarium,Scenedesmus,Oedogonium,Spirogyra,Occilatoria,Nostoc,Anabeana,Zygnema etc. The people living near the dam washed animals in such water reservoir, due to which the water is polluted and not safe for drinking purpose.
