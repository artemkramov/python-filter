A water samples were analyzed for different parameter like pH, E.C., TDS, TSS, Hardness, Chlorides, alkalinity, Acidity and MPN. The sampling frequency was once in a month. From study it was observed that all parameters were within limit expects alkalinity, chlorides. In bacteriological analysis it was observed that the entire sample was fully contaminated. By the sample analysis, visual observation and questionnaire survey it was concluded that, the quality of drinking water not much good in rainy season and health problem created in people.
