Nuclear structure and electromagnetic transition probability of Hf isotopes by means IBM-1
In this work, the energy levels and transition probabilities B(E2) and B(M1) of some even-even Hf have been investigated by using the interacting boson model-1 (IBM-1). The results were compared with experimental values. It was seen that an acceptable degree of agreement between the predictions of the model (IBM-1) and the experiment is achieved.
