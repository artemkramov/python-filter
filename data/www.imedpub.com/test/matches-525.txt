Nano cavity dependent thermodynamic study of Lennard-Jones Bio- fluids using scaled particle approach.
Efforts are made to estimate cavity size dependent, thermodynamic properties of some organic liquids, using scaled particle approach (SPA). The basic assumption applied is multiple of molecular weight with physical limitations of ratio of specific heats. Computations based on this assumption predict the closeness of values for ultrasonic wave velocity, thermodynamic molar volume and volume expansion coefficient. From the profile of the individual fluid the results are discussed in terms of cavity of nano scale and its associated energy at fixed temperature (liquid state). Further, closeness of computed thermodynamic properties is tested for different possible size of bio molecules in liquid state
