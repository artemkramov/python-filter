A descriptive study on ISO 9000 implementation obstacles within district councils
The implementation of the ISO 9000 quality management system in local authorities is one of the requisite requirements set by the Malaysian federal government since 1996 to ensure improvement within the services of these agencies as a part of the strategies in transforming the overall service quality in the public sector. After more than a decade, the total number of local authority (LA) organizations, especially district councils that have achieved ISO 9000 accreditation is very limited. This paper will determine and rank the implementation obstacles of ISO 9000 in district councils, since this type of LA organizations is seen as the majority that has failed to receive ISO 9000 accreditation. Study data was collected through a random survey with the use of a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire forms were circulated among team members who are part of the ISO 9000 implementation in their respective councils. A quantitative approach was used to analyze the data and based on the analysis outputs, this study revealed that there are five main obstacles faced by the ISO 9000 implementation team during the ISO 9000 execution process in district councils. These obstacles are negative perception or attitude towards quality among employees, lack of involvement, cooperation and commitment from employees, employees’ culture toward quality programmes, lack of human resources and lack of cooperation among internal departments.
