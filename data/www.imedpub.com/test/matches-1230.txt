Inhibitive behaviour of derivative of organic compound in RO product water storage system
The RO product water is more corrosive than the water produced by thermal distillation, Multistage Flash (MSF) evaporation and Multi Effect Desalination (MED) methods due to high TDS level, particularly chlorides. A study has been conducted to investigate the corrosion behaviour of aluminium in RO product water. Studies have been carried out in static conditions in the absence and presence of inhibitors system (phosphonate and zinc). Inhibition efficiency (I.E) has been calculated by total – immersion test. The possibility of formation of protective complex has been confirmed by UV – visible adsorption spectral study. Electrochemical methods like A.C. impedance and D.C. polarization have been used to confirm the protective film formation and the type of inhibition respectively
