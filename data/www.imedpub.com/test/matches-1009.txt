Diversity and distribution of shore birds in Tuticorin coastal area of Gulf of Mannar
The coastal wetlands of India are important for a large number of migratory water birds. However, despite the wealth of these habitats in India, few studies have considered the diverse communities of water birds they support. This study, carried out during 2010-2011 focused on the Tuticorin District coastal zone of South east coast of India. We studied the diversity of the avian fauna that occurs in this region of Gulf of Mannar. Charadriforimes is the largest order that gives many bird species and Phoenicopteriformes is the least order that contributes only Greater Flamingo. Limosa limosa, Caldris minuta are the common birds from the family Scolopacidae.
