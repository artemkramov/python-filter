Soret and dufour effects on MHD convective flow of heat and mass transfer over a moving non-isothermal vertical plate with heat generation/absorption
The present paper is to investigate the effect of linear thermal stratification in stable stationary ambient fluid on steady MHD convective flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting fluid along a moving, nonisothermal vertical plate in the presence of mass transfer, Soret and Dufour effects and heat generation or absorption. The governing equations of continuity, momentum and energy are transformed into ordinary differential equations using local similarity transformation. The resulting coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations are solved using Runge-Kutta fourth order method along with shooting technique. The velocity and temperature distributions are discussed numerically and presented through graphs. The numerical values of skin-friction coefficient and Nusselt number at the plate are derived, discussed numerically for various values of physical parameters and presented through Tables. The numerical results are benchmarked with the earlier study by Shrama and Singh [15] and found to be in excellent agreement.
