Physico-Chemical Analysis of Ground and Surface Water in Cuddalore District due to Effect of 2015 Monsoon
The piece of investigation is carried out to study the ground water quality as well as surface water quality, nutrient status and physico–chemical characteristics in Cuddalore district. The present work has been conducted by monitoring two types of ground water i.e., open well water and bore well water as well as of ponds, viz. temple pond, small pond and large community pond in the town. Attempts were made to study and analyze the physicochemical characteristics of the water. The work has been done by collecting samples from various villages of Cuddalore district and the chemical analysis is carried laboratory. A water quality standard is a rule or law comprised of the uses to be made of a water body or segment and the water quality criteria necessary to protect that uses, so a study has become necessary in the present days to determine suitability of these water for health.
