Synthesis and characterization of schiff base salicylaldehyde and thiohydrazones and its metal complexes
The ligand salicylaldehyde &amp; thiohydrazones was synthesized &amp; characterized by elemental analyses &amp; IR spectra. Its metal complexes with the metals Ti (III), V (III), VO (IV), CO (II) &amp; MN (III) were synthesized &amp; characterized by the determination of mp, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibilities, electronics &amp; IR spectral studies, Based on the studied &amp; octahedral geometry has been proposed for all the synthesized complexes
