Dinoflagellate cyst biozonation of upper cretaceous succession of Murshe-1 Well, Central Chad Basin, North East Nigeria
Palynological (Dinoflagellate Cyst) analyses of the Upper Creataceous succession in the Central Chad Basin, North East Nigeria was investigated. Thirty –three biostratigraphically significant dinoflagellate cyst species were recovered from interval 800m – 3928m of Murshe-1 Well. Based on the stratigraphic distribution (i.e. FAD and LAD) of these bioevents, six informal Dinoflagellate cyst assemblage zones from the Cenomanian to Maastrichtian are proposed.The zones in stratigraphically ascending order are as follows: Trichodinium magnum (Zone I), Batiacasphaera baticulata (Zone II), Cometodinium whitei (Zone III), Areoligera senonensis (Zone IV), Andalusiella laevigatum (Zone V) and Exchosphaeridium phragmites (Zone VI).The ages of these zones based on stratigraphic positions and series of first occurrences of key species are: Cenomanian (Zone I), Turonian (Zone II), Turonian (Zone III), Coniacian (Zone IV), Santonian (Zone V) and Campanian-Maastrichtian (Zone VI).
