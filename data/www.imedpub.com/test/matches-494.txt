Absorption Spectral Studies of Pr (III) with Acetyl acetone and their complexation with o-phenanthroline and bipyridyl
In present study, absorption spectral studies of Pr(III) with acetyl acetone [C5H8O2] and their adducts with dinitrogen donor ligands like, o-phenanthroline [C12H10N2O] and bipyridyl [C10H8N2] in methanol [ CH3OH ], dimethyl formamide [C3H7NO] and acetonitrile [CH3CN] was carried out. The intra 4ƒ-4ƒ transition spectra yield sharp bands which were analyzed individually by Gaussian curve analysis, the energy interaction parameters (FK,EK), Lande spin orbit coupling (ξ4f), nephelauxetic ratio (β), bonding parameter (b1/2), percent covalency (δ) were calculated and intensity parameters have been computed on computer using partial multiple regression analysis.
