Assessment of seven heavy metals in water of the river Ghaghara, a major tributary of the Ganga in Northern India
Water quality of the River Ghaghara has been examined in special reference to seven heavy metals namely cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and on seasonal basis for two consecutive years 2013-14 and 2014-15. Samples were collected from five stations namely Katernia ghat, Colonelganj, Ayodhya, Dohrighat, and Chhapra. In the water of the river maximum value of Co, Cu,Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn, Pb and was recorded as 0.027, 0.032, 0.007, 0.018, 0.043, 0.031and 0.019 mg/l respectively whereas the minimum value was recorded 0.005, 0.016, 0.001,0.005, 0.003, 0.013, 0.005 mg/l respectively at different sites. Most of the above values were found either below or closed the permissible limit set by World Health Organization (WHO) except Cd. Cadmium concentration exceeded the WHO limit. Cd contamination in the river water of this area is a serious concern for human health. Correlation analysis among all considered heavy metals shows positive correlation with each other in both the years. The data generated may provide useful information to Governmental agencies to control the heavy metal pollution of the river at these urban centers which may even be worst in future scenario. The present experimental data indicates that the pollution level along the river Ghaghara is not very high but the increasing population load in the basin may cause irreparable ecological harm in the long-term well masked by short term economic prosperity
