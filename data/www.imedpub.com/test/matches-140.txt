To study the solvent effect and staining properties of T. patula dye extracted from wasted temple french marigold flower
The T.Patula dye is easily make from French marigold which is widely used in temple after use the flowers are thrown in river and cause river pollution so in this work we have use that, wasted French marigold flower and minimise the river pollution. The solvent effect study of T.Patula dye shows high absorbance in various solvent and interesting outcome of this work is that T.Patula dye show the staining properties in water conductive tissue i.e. xylem of plant so it is use as stain in botany laboratory.
