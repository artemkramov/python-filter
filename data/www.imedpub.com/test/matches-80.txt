Influence of natural fermentation, malt addition and soya-fortification on the sensory and physico-chemical characteristics of Ibyer-Sorghum gruel
The influence of natural fermentation, malt addition and soya fortification on the sensory and physico-chemical characteristics of ‘Ibyer’, a sorghum gruel was studied. Eight gruel samples were produced and subjected to sensory evaluation after which the most acceptable five were reproduced for further quality’ evaluation. The pH and titratable acidity (TA) ranged from 4.88 to 6.16 and 0.31% to 0.14% respectively for the gruel from fermented meal with added malt (FGM) and that produced from non-fermented sorghum meal (NFG). Fermentation with malt addition considerably lowered the pH and increased the TA of the products. Fermentation coupled with malt addition also resulted in products of reduced viscosity, higher total solids, total soluble solids, bulk density and energy values
