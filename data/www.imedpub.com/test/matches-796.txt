Optical characterization of Ge0.15Se0.85-xAgx (0  0.20) Glasses
In the present work we have predicted the optical and some physical parameters viz. coordination number (r), number of constraints (Ncon), no. of lone-pair electrons(L), heat of atomization (Hs) and the compositional effect on the optical gap theoretically. It has been found that  , Hs, Eg and the energetic parameter (A). An attempt has been made to explain the varying trends of various parameters with increasing Ag content. Spectral dependence of the absorption coefficient is verified by the energetic parameter relation Vs composition.
