Plasma glucose in Telfairia occidentalis treated rats
Telfairia occidentalis is a green vegetable popularly consumed among the native of Africa and it’s generally believed to be of medicinal value. In this study, a total of 14 adult rats weighing between 150 to 200g were procured and divided into two groups A and B. Group A (control) was fed with normal rat diet (standard chow), while group B (test) was fed with Telfairia occidentalis diet (a mixture of normal feed plus 13% by weight Telfairia occidentalis leaves) for a period of 30 days. The result showed a statistical significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in the plasma glucose level of the test group compared to the control. This study suggests therefore that Telfairia occidentalis increases the plasma level of glucose and would not be fit for consumption by diabetic patients.
