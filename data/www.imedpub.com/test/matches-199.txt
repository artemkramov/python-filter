Interacting blends of novel acrylated poly(ester-amide) resins-III with methyl methacrylate monomer part-1
Bisphthalamic acids were prepared by reaction of phthalic anhydride and aliphatic diamines. Novel poly(esteramide) resins (PEAs) were prepared by reaction between diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-C (DGEBC) with bisphthalamic acids using a base catalyst like triethylamine (TEA). The post reactions of all these PEAs were carried out by using acryloyl chloride. The resultant products are designated as acrylated poly(ester-amide) resins (APEAs). The PEAs and APEAs were characterized by elemental analysis, number average molecular weight determined by non-aqueous conductometric titration method. IR spectra of PEAs were also recorded. Blending of these APEAs were carried out with methyl methacrylate monomer. The curing of these APEAs- methyl methacrylate monomer blends was monitored on a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) by using benzoyl peroxide as a catalyst. Based on DSC data, the glass fiber reinforced composites of APEAs- methyl methacrylate monomer blends have been fabricated and their chemical, mechanical and electrical properties have been evaluated. The unreinforced cured samples of APEAs- methyl methacrylate monomer blends were analyzed thermogravimetrically (TGA).
