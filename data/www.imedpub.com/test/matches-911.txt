Peristaltic flow of a couple stress fluid in an inclined channel under the effect of magnetic field
The present paper investigates the peristaltic motion of a couple stress fluid in a two dimensional inclined channel with the effect of magnetic field. The effects of various physical parameters on velocity, pressure gradient and friction force have been discussed &amp; computed numerically. The effects of various key parameters are discussed with the help of graphs
