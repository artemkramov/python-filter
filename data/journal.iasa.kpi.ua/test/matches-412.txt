M. Z. Zgurovsky, T. A. Matorina, D. A. Prilutsky, D. A. Abroskin
A system of factors (indices and indicators) and a new method named «Sustainable Development Gauging Matrix» (SDGM) culminated in a Global Simulation regarding the quality of life and security of the world population are developed. The initial data for this simulation were presented by reliable international organizations. Specifically, this study focuses on applying SDGM to analysis of the Systematic Regularity of World Conflicts over the Course of Time. A prognosis is detailed of the next world conflict, labeled the «Conflict of XXI Century», and an analysis is provided of its nature and main characteristics suck as duration, main phases and intensity. This prognosis details a set of basic global threats that spawn this conflict. With using cluster analysis, their influence on different countries of the world is accurately defined. Inferences are drawn from specific hypotheses as to possible scenarios occurring during the system conflict and after its conclusion.
