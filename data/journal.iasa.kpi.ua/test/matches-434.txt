Determination of maximal weighting flow in new generation networks
E. Yu. Zaychenko, Yuriy P. Zaychenko, Ovi Nafas Aghaei agh Ghamish
The problem of finding maximal weighted flow (MWF) in new generation networks is considered. The principal differences of the considered problem from the classical one constitute therein that several classes of flows are transmitted in a network and non-linear constraints on Quality of Service (QoS) are introduced. The theorem about properties of a maximal weighted flow is proved and optimality conditions for a maximal weighted flow under constraints on QoS obtained. The algorithm of finding MWF under constraints on QoS for different classes of flows is developed. The algorithm may be applied for survivability estimation in communication networks with perspective technologies.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>new generation networks; Maximal weighted flow; optimality conditions; QoS
