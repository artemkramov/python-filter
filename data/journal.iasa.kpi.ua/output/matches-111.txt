3D-model reconstruction with use of monocular RGB camera
Oleg V. Vedmedenko, Sergii S. Nikolaiev, Y. A. Tymoshenko
Every year the edge between the real and digital worlds is becoming more and more blurred. Augmented and virtual reality rapid development creates new opportunities for more productive work and entertainment, revolution in 3D printing technologies begets boost in multiple DIY communities appearance and sharing economy growth. All these factors require new technologies that allow making 3D models from real world objects, but most of these solutions are either very expensive or require complex technical knowledge that most ordinary people do not have. This paper provides a review and comparison of modern methods for 3D models of physical objects real time reconstruction that can be used in present-day mobile solutions.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>3D model; 3D object; simultaneous localization and mapping problem; SLAM; monocular camera; RGB camera; LSD-SLAM; ORB-SLAM
