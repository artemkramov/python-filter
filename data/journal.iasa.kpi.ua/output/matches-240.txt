Optimal control of drug therapy and physiotherapy models for the problem of reconstraction of bone tissue
V. P. Martsenyuk, D. V. Vakulenko, I. Ye. Andrushchak
The problem of building the drug therapy and physiotherapy models is presented as a problem of an optimal control with state limits for the model of reconstruction of bone tissue. The model includes the follocoing factors: population of osteocytes, osteoblasts and the density of the matrix. This approach has been numerically implemented using VisSim software.
