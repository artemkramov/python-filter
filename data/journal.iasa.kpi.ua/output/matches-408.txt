Cyclic self-recovery of human knowledge system under its passive dissipation
V. V. Yasinskiy
Some phases of cyclic self-recovery of the human knowledge system under conditions of its passive dissipation are identified. The Hebbinhaus forgetting curves are known to reflect the process of passive dissipation of the human knowledge system within certain time periods only. The research is based on system generalization of the results of the long-lasting educational process quality monitoring in the NTUU "KPI". A special attention is paid to information analysis of superposition of very large empiric samples, which illustrates the action of the mechanism of long-lasting preservation of human knowledge in the format of nonlinear "resonant amplification" of the so-called "small effects" of complex psychophysiologic nature.
