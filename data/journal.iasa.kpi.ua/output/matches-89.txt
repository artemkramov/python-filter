Knowledge-based information support formation for complex systems research
Tatiana V. Kozulia, N. V. Sharonova, Mariia M. Kozulia
This paper presents existing methods and models for the analysis of objects of social, ecological and economic nature and formation of the knowledge-based system for decision-making based on knowledge identification. The information and algorithmic support for practical management application of an arbitrary level complexity system object under conditions of the information uncertainty is presented. The justification process for employment feasibility of provisions from the synergetics and nonlinear theory of complex systems while modeling the system object's behavior is considered. The project is developed of the knowledge-based information-software system that provides the information processing for complex systems research.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>system object; knowledge based system; logical net; complex system; entropy assessment; knowledge base; entropy and comparator assessment; comparator identification
