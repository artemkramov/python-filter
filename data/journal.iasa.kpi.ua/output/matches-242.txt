On the periodic solutions of the quasilinear ordinary differential equations of second order
Ju. Е. Bokhonov
The approach to the determination of the periodic solutions of the quasilinear differential equation of second order is proposed. The approach is based on the determination of the influence for function for the differential operator, defined on the functions, which satisfy the periodic boundary conditions. The necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of the periodic equation solutions are given.
