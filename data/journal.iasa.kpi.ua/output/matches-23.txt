Blockchain as a service for medical records
Anatoly Petrenko, Roman Kyslyi, Ihor Pysmennyi
Storing and sharing healthcare data is challenging. Despite different data types that can be used on different platforms, also there is a question of security of gathered data. Storing data in a traditional way may cause data leak and it unavailability in critical moments. In this work we present decentralized way of storing patient data that can be used to avoid security and unavailability problems. A blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that contains connected blocks of transactions. Unlike other ledger approaches, blockchain guarantees tamper proof storage of approved transactions.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Cloud computing; Medical records; Distributed databases; Computer science; Online carehelping; Sensor data storage
