The features of human decision making for complex interdisciplinary problems solution
Vasyl M. Gorbachuk, O. S. Makarenko
The peculiarities of decision making by a person, considered by D. Kaneman and V.&nbsp;Smith, were analyzed. The limitation of the assumption of constructivist rationality underlying the classical economic theory, when postulating the rationality of the behavior of all its participants, each of which always manages to maximize its utility function, is considered. The connection between the internal way of thinking (how the mind or brain works) and the behavior in the conditions of individual decision-making, social interaction, market institutions are discussed. Some further directions of research and settings are proposed along with the opportunities for new formulations of interdisciplinary tasks, including system analysis and modeling. The results of research on the experimental economy from the observation of its state in the studies of existing market institutions are presented. Constructive and environmental rationality, neuroeconomics and possibilities of their mutual influence are considered.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>decision making; limited rationality; environmental rationality; experimental economics; neuroeconomics
