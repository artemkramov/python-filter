Yu. І. Kislenko
The chain of transformation "reality–text" is analysed as an unviolation of the integrity of the displayed fragment of reality on the way of translation of this information from the graphic to linguistic level. The structural-functional level of neuron organization of visual track, which provides adequate perception of the environment (triune in time, space and action) is considered by force of a selection of separate situations, differentiation them by statistical or dynamical features with the unique identification of their components. Linguistic means and their organization are analysed in order to adequately display a separate fragment of reality.
