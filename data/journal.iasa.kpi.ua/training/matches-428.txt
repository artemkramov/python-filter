Analysis of the nuclear reactor core of Chernobyl Power Plant for 5 seconds before explosion with three-dimensional spherical space
Yoshio Matsuki, Petro I. Bidyuk
This research analyzed the water flow and bubble (void) of nuclear reactor core of Chernobyl Power Plant, for 5 seconds before the explosion, using a mathematical model of two-dimensional spherical coordinates. To solve the problem, we considered this phenomenon as an analogy of Newtonian gravity theory, which had been solved in Schwarzchild Solution. As a result, the calculated radius of the spherical space of water and bubble indicated the maximum limit, at which the reactor core lost the control of reactor power. And, then, a regression analysis, with exponential model, confirmed the influence of bubble and water to the reactor’s power.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>nuclear power plant;Chornobyl disaster;critical operation mode;regression&nbsp;analysis;void and water environment
