Constrained disturbances suppression in cognitive maps’ impulse processes based on H∞ theory under incomplete measurements of vertices coordinates
Victor D. Romanenko, Yuriy L. Milyavsky
The problem of controlling an impulse process of a cognitive map, provided that some of the coordinates are not measured, is stated and solved in the paper. It is assumed that non-measurable coordinates are limited, but their probabilistic characteristics are unknown. The control algorithm is based on the adaptation of the H<sub>∞</sub>-theory to the conditions of a complex dynamic system in the impulse process mode of a cognitive map. For this purpose, the system is decomposed into measurable and non-measurable subsystems, a&nbsp;target vector of vertices coordinates to be stabilized is chosen, a measurement equation is introduced, and a robust optimality criterion of control is formulated. The method proposed in the paper is verified for the cognitive map of IT company HR management, which has a large number of non-measurable vertices. Based on the computer simulation, the suitability and effectiveness of applying the proposed control method was demonstrated.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>cognitive map; impulse process; robust control; H∞-theory; incomplete measurements of coordinates; limited perturbations
