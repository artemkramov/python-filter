Empirical analysis of Chernobyl nuclear reactor core for 5 seconds before the explosion
Yoshio Matsuki, Petro I. Bidyuk
This study uses the methodology of empirical analysis for analyzing the transient mode of the nuclear reactor core, a few second before the explosion at the time of the Chernobyl accident. The parameters were selected from the published articles [1]. A scenario was assumed for this analysis, such as the reduction of the flow rate of the Main Circulation Pump, and regression models were constructed to examine this scenario. The results of the models application were examined, and conclusions were made regarding the reduction of the flow rate of the Main Circulation Pump and the reactivity during the last few seconds to the explosion.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Chernobyl accident;critical operating mode;regression analysis;water and empty environment
