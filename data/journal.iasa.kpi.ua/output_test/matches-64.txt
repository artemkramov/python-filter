Stent fracture and restenosis has been analyzed in the article. The hypothesis has been made that the cyclic (systolic and diastolic) mechanical deformations of the coronary arteries were a pathogenetic factor of in-stent restenosis development. The paper is devoted to the development of the software system that automates the proposed methods for assessing coronary artery deformations to choose the method of myocardial revascularization: stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting. The computer-aided diagnostic system has been developed. It allows to take into account the cyclic deformation of the coronary arteries in assessing the optimal method of surgical intervention. The software can also display 3D-reconstruction of the coronary arteries. The obtained results allow to improve long-term results of treatment, to decrease the likelihood of rehospitalization, and also to reduce the cost of the treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
