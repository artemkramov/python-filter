Vladimir A. Svjatnyj, Daniella Yu. Brovkina
This paper is dedicated to the study of the transition of manufacturing to a new stage of its development due to the introduction of the latest computer technologies, that have become common in the service sector, into the automation process. One of the characteristic features of the development of modern industry is the integration of the achievements of the theory and practice of automation, information technology, robotics and "humanâ€“automated object" systems. "Industry 4.0" was designed as a promising high-tech project under the supervision of the Federal Government of Germany with a focus on information and communication technologies. Today, however, this concept has expanded considerably and now is a collective system for European technologies and concepts for the organization of a new generation of production chains. Thus, in the paper, the modern meaning of "Industry 4.0" concept is described and the main ideas and technologies used for its implementation are summarized.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>industry 4.0; big data; internet of things; machine-to-machine communication; SMAC; smart factory; cyber-physical system; industrial internet
