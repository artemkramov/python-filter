Formation and digital horizons of science
M. Z. Zgurovsky, A. I. Petrenko
In today's world, the science and high technology are increasingly invading the space of everyday reality, affect the human interaction with the environment, rapidly change the modern society image, enhancing and complicating communication, opening up new opportunities for external and internal resources. The basic features of the current science state in the modern society are considered and summarized, the main reason for the success of which is the rapid development of a new computer technology, the creation of complex and powerful distributed systems or the computing grid infrastructure, provid-ing tools for high-performance computing, quick access to huge data sets, and effective communication. Such a science, known as the "digital science", relies on the use of e-infrastructures, services, and tools for data- and computing-intensive research in virtual and collaborative environments based on ICT in conjunction with the possibilities of openness and collaboration over the Internet. In addition, parts of this electronic infra-structure are unique scientific instruments â€” heavy duty electron microscopes, particle accelerators, sophisticated medical equipment, etc. New tools and new research methods make it possible not only to conduct research more efficiently, but also to create new areas of science and research, which are more open, more global and common, more creative, and closer to the society.
