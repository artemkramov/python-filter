Some deterministic models of fuzzy linear programming problems
Y. A. Zack
We consider deterministic equivalents of various formulations of linear programming prob-lems, in which the coefficients of the objective function, constraints and the boundary values of the variables of the problem and the right-hand side are represented by fuzzy sets. The methods for comparing the fuzzy sets and selecting the best ones are proposed. The problem of finding the vec-tor of variables as a vector of real numbers is reduced to solving the one-criterion or multicriteria problem with the significantly large number of constraints. In solving the problem as a vector of Fuzzy-sets, the equivalent problem was determined â€“ a sequence of linear programming problems. The formulated problems can be solved by the simplex method.
