Method of synchronous dataflow scheduling
–ê. M. Sergiyenko, V. P. Simonenko
The scheduling problem for the synchronous dataflow graph (SDF) is considered. A method of the SDF scheduling is proposed which is based on transforming SDF into spatial SDF. The circular schedule has the period of<em>L</em>cycles. Each spatial SDF node has the coordinates of space and time of an event, where and when the respective algorithm steps were performed. A set of restrictions, which the SDF nodes have, helps to derive the circular schedule with the optimum load balancing. So, the nodes, which are mapped into a single resource, must not have the same clock cycles modulo<em>L</em>, and the number of such nodes has to approach<em>L</em>. The resulting schedule is implemented in the pipelined datapath. The algorithm for computing the suboptimal schedule is proposed based on the spatial SDF.
