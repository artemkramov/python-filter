Using of the trend geospatial statistical models based on data mining
An application of geospatial trending statistical models for analysis the data on the sustainable development of Ukraine was studied. The mathematical apparatus was used in the construction of trend geospatial statistical models. Using the hierarchical model data of sustainable development as an example, a study on geospatial trends and the nature of their origin by constructing polynomial regression models based on the processing of geospatial data was conducted. The method for detecting geospatial trends in hierarchical data models was developed based on cartographic methods and the first and second order polynomials. The use of cartometric methods for estimating the parameters of geospatial trends was proposed. The application of methods for constructing geospatial trends as part of data mining was justified.
