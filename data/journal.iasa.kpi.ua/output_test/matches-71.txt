In this paper, the problem of synthesis of the information security system with optimal properties is considered, namely the problem of synthesis of the structure of the information security system with the required level of information security and the lowest cost of a security system. An economic indicator is used as an extreme criterion (minimizing the cost of a security system), and the restriction is the fixed level of information security. To solve this problem, we propose a method using a logical- probabilistic approach. On its basis, the function of the probability of success of an attack is constructed that takes into account the structure of the information and communication system. As a result, we obtain the problem of nonlinear discrete boolean optimization which is solved using the method of boundaries and branches. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by the numerical experiment on a model of an information and communication system.</p><p><br></p>
