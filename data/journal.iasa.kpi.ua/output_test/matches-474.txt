D. O. Polishchuk, O. D. Polishchuk, M. S. Yadzhak
Methods of complex deterministic evaluation of the complex systems with a hierarchical-network structure, components of which are methods of local, forecasting, aggregative, and interactive estimation of the state, function quality, and interaction of objects comprising the system are proposed. The main approaches to the construction of generalized conclusions about the state and quality of functioning of the system at different levels of the hierarchy (methods of the "weakest" element, weighted linear and nonlinear aggregation) are described. Areas of their use are defined and the main advantages and drawbacks are analyzed. The various directions of implementation of the weighted linear aggregation method for evaluations of elements of the system and its basic subsystems are considered in detail. Principles for visualizing the results of the aggregate evaluation for timely localization of the structural elements of the system which received negative or close to them conclusions are proposed. Effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated by the analysis of quality of the objects of the track and station facilities of the rail transport system of Ukraine.
