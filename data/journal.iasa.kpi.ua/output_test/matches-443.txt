Mathematical modeling of contact interaction of rigid base with surface axially-symmetric groove and electroelastic half-space
Vitaliy Kirilyuk, Olga Levchuk
The mathematical model of the contact interaction under compression of electroelastic halfspace with the rigid base which contains an axially symmetric sloping groove (under inner pressure) was considered. The model takes into account the connectedness of the electroelastic equation system. The algorithm for solving this problem was developed. By means of solving the coupled equations system of electroelasticity and harmonic functions of a special kind, the explicit solution was found, geometrical parameters of clearance between bodies under known compressure and inner pressure were found. The connectedness effect of force and electric fields was revealed. As a particular case from obtained expressions, the contact parameters for elastic transversally isotropic half-space were found.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>mathematical model;couple system of equations;electroelastic half-space;rigid base;axially symmetric sloping groove;compression and inner pressure;algorithm of problem solution;effect of connectedness fields
