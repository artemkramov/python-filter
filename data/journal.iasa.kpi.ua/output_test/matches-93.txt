Ensuring the sustainability of pulse processes in cognitive maps on the basis of the models in the states space
V. D. Romanenko, Yu. L. Milyavskiy
The problem of correspondence between cognitive maps and models of the process dynamics in the states space, and also the control of a cognitive map in order to ensure its stability were considered. The method of transition from a state-space model to the cognitive map is proposed. It is shown how including of the state controller can be reflected in the corresponding cognitive map. We also discuss the case when state vector is unobservable and Luenberger observer is used. It is proved that in some cases from asymptotic stability of the state-space model absolute stability of the cognitive map implies. The method of inverse transition from a cognitive map to the state space is proposed. Stabilizing method for unstable cognitive maps using state control is obtained. The practical example demonstrating application of the proposed methods is discussed.
