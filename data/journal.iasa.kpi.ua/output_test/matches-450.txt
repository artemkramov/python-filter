In this paper, the necessity for creating new ecological principles in terms of the theoretical analysis and practical implementation of the foundations of sustainable development, implementing a synergetic, entropy-information component in the methodological support of integrated environmental assessment system objects was justified. Supportive comprehensive assessment of environmental quality is provided in the form of integration methods of principal components and comparing identification when using diverse initial information on the characteristics of the system object. A practical application of presented proposals is considered using as an example the study of technologically loaded regional structures using monitoring information.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>entropy-information component;comprehensive assessment;principal components;comparing identification;algorithmic and program complex
