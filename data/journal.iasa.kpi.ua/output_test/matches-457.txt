The scenario approach and the Bayesian method in assessing the risks of system accidents at hydraulic structures
Kateryna G. Romanchuk, Dmytro V. Stefanyshyn
Within the scenario approach to forecasting technogenic accidents, the Bayesian method was used to assess the risks of system failures at hydraulic structures. The definitions and assertions relating to the risk of technogenic accidents within the scenario approach were formulated, and a general statement of the problem to quantify the risk of accidents at hydraulic structures within the scenario approach using Bayesian transformation of probabilities of emergency events was performed. It is shown that the scenario approach that uses Bayesian transformation of probabilities allows assessing the total (summary) risk of a system accident at hydraulic structures that can occur due to arbitrary events, including simultaneous, emergency events with different consequences, according to certain model incompatible scenarios of the origin and course of the accident, which form a complete group of events.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>accident;Bayesian method;model scenario;probability;risk of damages;scenario approach;waterwork
