The planning optimization of tasks distribution and data packets transportation in a distributed computer network
Roman P. Krasniuk, Grygoriy G. Tsegelyk
The problems of volume-scheduling of distribution tasks and transportation of data packets in a distributed computing network were studied. The mathematical statement was made, effective computational algorithms were developed, and approximate solutions of these problems were obtained. The efficiency was shown of the proposed computational algorithms to build an approximate solution for single- and multi optimization problems on the basis of a comparative analysis of the application of these algorithms using test examples. The conclusion was made about the time complexity of proposed algorithms.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>optimization;distributed computing network;mathematical modeling;numerical algorithms
