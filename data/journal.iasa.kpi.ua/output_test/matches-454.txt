The purpose of this paper is to study the EUV waves using epipolar geometry. EUV wave is still investigated and remains a subject of continuous research. The recovery of spatial structure of EUV wave would allow to explain its origin, and to assess the physical nature of the kinematic characteristics. An approach was proposed based on epipolar geometry to solve the problem of identification and matching of objects in stereo images from a spacecraft and determine the height of the wave. Also, conditions were investigated when the matching problem becomes ill conditioned and degenerate.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>spatial structure;sun;spacecrafts images;euv wave;epipolar geometry
