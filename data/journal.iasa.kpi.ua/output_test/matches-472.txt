Function approximation for building the algorithm for the rough terrain description
Oleksandr Mykolayovych Trofymchuk, Olga Oleksandrivna Kryazhych
The paper studies one version of the piecewise polynomial approximation using the "possible directions" method and G. Zoutendijk's method to solve the problems of describing complex functions. In particular, the problem with one quadratic constraint was presented and the methods of quadratic programming with a prior statement of the dual problems were used to solve it. To solve this problem we use an approach based on the duality theory applying a direct algorithm of the simplex method. The algorithm is presented with the goal of the further software implementation. The conclusions are made about the practical value of this research, in particular, about the possibility of expanding the tools for decision-makers for describing the affected areas of rough terrain by man-made accidents and justification of a new approach for constructing three-dimensional models of convex and concave objects.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>function; polynomial, approximation; derivative
