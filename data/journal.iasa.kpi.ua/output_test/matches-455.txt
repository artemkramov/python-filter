Identification and dealing with uncertainties in the form of incomplete data by data mining methods
Nataliia V. Kuznietsova
In this paper, the methods for processing missing data are reviewed. The classification of methods depending on input data, data types and formats, and causes of data incompleteness associated with influence of uncertainties of the outside world and modeling object is proposed. The commonalities and differences between existing methods are investigated. The application peculiarities of these methods for filling missing data depending on properties of uncertainties are determined. It is shown that the traditional approach for filling the missing data by average values does not allow obtaining correct forecasts in many cases due to changes in sampleâ€™s properties. The usage of data mining methods technologies for dealing with missing data is proposed. An example of using regression methods is shown for filling missing data, in particular, using the forecast evaluation.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>risks analysis;data mining;Bayesian networks;informational technologies;system analysis
