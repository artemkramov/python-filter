Aggressive and peaceful behavior in multiagent systems on cellular space
Valentin V. Zavertanyy, Alexander S. Makarenko
One of the key issues in Multi-Agent simulation approach is a consolidation of great model variety. Many researches govern own unique models that are similar in basic principles but for complex adaptive systems such as Artificial Ecosystems slight difference in architecture and parameters calibration could affect crucially on the emergent properties of the model. As it was denoted by the pioneers of the Artificial Ecosystems modelling Robert Axtell and Robert Axelrod: variety of Multi-Agent models need introduction of methods and technics that allows consolidating of its results. In work we present modification of model similar to classic Artificial Life spatial lattice models and trace the exhibition of aggressive and peaceful behavior depending on the income resource. We consider results of both modelsâ€™ simulation as it was proposed in "docking models" method by Axtell and Axelrod.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>artificial life;multiagent;neuroevolition;predator-prey
