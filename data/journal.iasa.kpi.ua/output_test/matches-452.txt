Investigation of the problems of the allocation of resources among enterprises
Alla P. Iakovleva, Ivan O. Kurdup
The problem of the allocation of resources among enterprises from different industries as parts of the economic conglomerate is considered. The different ways of stating the problem and inputting the data, taking into account the possibility of building their own functions of return, control action, and time are presented. The key method of solving the problem is the dynamic programming [1]. Also, we investigated an alternative formalization of the problem in which the phase and control variables may take an infinite number of values, which made it impossible to use standard tables for dynamic programming and lead to analytical calculations. In the latter case, we provide a number of limitations, which convert the function of return to the form that satisfies the conditions of production functions.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>dynamic programming equation;multistage process;optimal resources allocation;production function
