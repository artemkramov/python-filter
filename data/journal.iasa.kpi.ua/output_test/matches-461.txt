Tools for construction drawings of geological cross-sections
Yu. A. Tarnavskyy
Ensuring the safety of an industrial facility requires the monitoring of soil underneath and storing this information in the form of technical documents. The task of constructing the geological cross-sections in the area of the object and their storage in the form of construction drawings is especially important. However, to date, these problems were solved using the "manual" mode and no existing software for constructing the geological cross-sections has provided the possibility for creating construction drawings. The work is devoted to problems developing the tools for building design drawings of geological cross-sections automatically using computer-aided design AutoCAD. The results are shown as two modules. One of them is the plugin based on AutoCAD .NET API (C # - application) and another is AutoLISP-application for working with customer hatch patterns.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>radar; geologic section; constructive drawing; computer-aided design; templates AutoCAD
