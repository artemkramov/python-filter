Analyzing the particularities of electronic circuits simulation in the software package Simulink using a transistor amplifier as an example
Means of simulation of electronic circuits in software package Simulink are considered in the article using the model of a transistor amplifier as an example, assembled as a common-emitter circuit. It is shown, that for making models of electronic components mathematical blocks are very important, and for simulation of electrical connections the blocks of electrical and electronic components are convenient to use. For simulation of complex electronic systems the block-hierarchical approach is very suitable. It is shown, that the means of simulation in software package Simulink are very effective for making the models of electronic circuits and that they can be the real alternative to CAD software for the modern electronic circuits simulation.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Simulation of electronic circuits; Simulation of Electronic Components; Simulink
