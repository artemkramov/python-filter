The chaotic and random components in time series data
V. G. Bondarenko
We proposed a method for determining the ratio of deterministic and stochastic components for observed real data. We illustrated a number of numerical experiments which used simulation modelling of the logistic chaotic sequence and the values of fractional Brownian motion with different values of Hurst exponent<em>H</em>. In the additive mixture, the ratio of the energies of deterministic and random components are defined. The chaotic term turns out to be more aggressive for large values of Hurst exponent: the control statistics of the mixture are different from the reference values corresponding to the fractional Brownian motion. Another situation takes place for small values of<em>H</em>(antipersistent case). The considered examples of time series data are described by an antipersistent model.
