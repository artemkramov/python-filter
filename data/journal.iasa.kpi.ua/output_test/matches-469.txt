This article describes the application of the method of constructing the static nonlinear dependencies in dynamic electrical objects to optimize their functioning. The method of construction includes two components: 1) determining the non-parametric model of the static nonlinearity with arbitrary object dynamics, followed by its piecewise analytical identification; 2) the integration of individual models into the complete model using selective functions analytic in the entire range instead of non-analytic signum functions. A number of examples were presented of using the proposed methodology for the identification and optimization of electrical facilities: the generator and DC motor as the part of the automatic control system and the solar panel.
