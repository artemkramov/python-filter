A new approach is proposed to the construction of mathematical models of the functioning and development of production systems as comprehensive systems of models that are designed for the calculation of the future state of the system based on existing technologies and products production as well as for research on the models of productions, which are being created. The system of models is created on the basis of the three-level decomposition: structural, functional, and reduction. These models belong to different structural classes of models of functioning and development: models of optimal development based on the variational problem of development with integral criterion of the first kind and uncertainties specified by statistical parameters; models of functioning and development of system of manufacturers of a certain production segment, in the environment where the production system under study is located, and uncertainties are generated by the active environment. The simulation results reproduce the known characteristics of real production systems.
