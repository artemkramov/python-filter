Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of steganograms
D. –ê. Progonov, S. N. Kushch
The paper investigates the multifractal de trended fluctuation analysis usage for identification the transformations, which have been employed for embedding the stego data in digital images. It is shown that applying both the standard (the discrete wavelet transform) and special (singular value decomposition) transforms for message hiding leads to significant changes of fractal parameters of pixel brightness of images (the width of the multifractal spectrum). Distinctive changes of the multifractal detrended analysis results for steganograms in comparison with unfilled cover images allow to determine the type of a transformation, which has been applied for message hiding in the transform domain of a container. It has been determined that applying the multifractal detrended analysis makes it possible to additionally estimate the level of detail of embedded stegodata in case of using the standard transformations. Obtained results can be used for increasing the efficiency of modern methods of the active steganalysis of digital images.
