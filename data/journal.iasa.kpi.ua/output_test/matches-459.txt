Methods of the comprehensive deterministic evaluation of the complex systems with the hierarchical-network structure, components of which are methods of local, forecasting, aggregative, and interactive analysis of the state, the quality of functioning and interaction of objects that form such a system are proposed. The method is described for an interactive evaluation of the basic system’s objects interaction which is the effective means of continuous monitoring of the quality of their functioning. This method allows to track the dynamics of the change in the quality of processing of the flows at the nodes and their passing through the edges of the network, to analyze the schedule optimality of flows and its sensitivity to small delays, to evaluate the workload of the main system objects. Forecasting the behavior of interactive evaluations makes it possible, without waiting for the next scheduled study, to determine the elements that threaten the normal functioning of the network, and their aggregation allows to determine system’s objects that do not function satisfactorily at the different levels of the hierarchy. Effectiveness of the method is illustrated by the analysis of the interaction of the objects of railway transport system of Ukraine.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>complex system; hierarchical network structure; evaluation; forecasting; aggregation; continuous monitoring; interaction
