Advanced analytics is one of the most required information technologies. Research of a scenario formation process of analytical activity is required for advanced analytics realization. Analytical activity scenarios define order of analytical activity conduction for obtainment of necessary information that assist to produce informed decisions. Scenario formation contains of scenarios building and optimization. The subject of the article is improvement of domain model over which analytical activity is performed. Object-oriented modeling method and adaptive object model approach is used to build analyzable domain object model. An adaptive object model that submits classes, attributes and relationships as metadata is built. Use of improving domain model in scenario area method that is used for scenario optimization conducts to enhancement of scenario optimization results. Scenario area method is adopted with account of domain object model building that includes analytical activity scenarios. Class diagram has been developed for domain and scenarios object model and can be used as computer model element of information-analytical program platform.</p>
