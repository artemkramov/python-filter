A help matrix of the merge flows in optimization problems of packings on multicommodity networks
The method for computing the help matrix of merging the small packages of discrete flows during solving the optimization of packings problem in multicommodity networks with restrictions on the period of delivery or the number of merges of flows is proposed. On the basis of the proved statements, efficient computing algorithms for determining the nodes of merge and merged flows with the use of the help matrix for all pairs in a network are developed. Algorithms may be used inside the basic optimization schemes for calcu-lating the time of delivery of flows to the destination and checking for the appropriate restrictions during solving the various optimization problems of packings on transport networks, and also during the design and analysis of message transfers in virtual contain-ers in the state-of-the-art trunk data networks such as Backbone.</p>
