Connection between Petri nets and Polish notation
Vitaly M. Statkevich
We propose Petri nets that produce languages of Polish notation and reverse Polish notation for propositional formulas and mathematical expressions. Propositional formulas can contain a given number of variables and mathematical expressions. Arithmetic expressions can contain a given number of variables and constants. We also propose inhibitor nets that produce the fixed-point binary numbers in mathematical expressions for above-mentioned languages. The technique of the nets construction allows to use arbitrary functions with a given arity. We also propose a coloured Petri net for calculating values of propositional formulas in reverse Polish notation. The technique of the net construction allows to use arbitrary functions with a given arity using a truth table of a corresponding function.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>Petri net;inhibitor Petri net;coloured Petri net;Petri net language;Polish notation;reverse Polish notation
