The article presents Ð° review of software and technologies of geographic information systems in the context of applying them to solve practical problems of the territorial segmentation, mathematical models of which are reduced to continuous problems of optimal multiplex-partitioning of sets. In this case, service zone models are understood as geometry-based procedures for creating theoretical service zones using characteristics of the service center and assumptions about the customer behavior. The basic requirements to the data used in developed software, that includes methods for solving problems of multiplex-partitioning of sets and GIS technologies, are described. The results of segmentation of the city area into zones that are served by several service centers are given, taking into account the possibility of zones overlapping. An approach to solving problems of the optimal placement of service centers in a limited nonconvex incoherent region with a simultaneous segmentation is proposed.</div><br></div><div><h4>Keywords</h4><br><div>continuous problems of optimal multiplex-partitioning of sets; geographic information systems; GIS technologies; territorial segmentation
