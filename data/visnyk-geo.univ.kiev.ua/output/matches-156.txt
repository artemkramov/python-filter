It is&nbsp;viewed upon as a complex socio-economic phenomenon which includes four consecutive stages. It has been determined that when investigating the territorial organization of city public transportation both general and special scientific approaches and methods are used. At the preparatory phase the role and place of public transportation in municipal economy are determined, the nature of public transportation service is analyzed, satisfactoriness and insufficiency of its functions are estimated and, as a result, social services commissioning on the development of public transportation system is defined and the concept of its research is developed. The second phase is a conceptual and informational one. At this phase societal and geographical model of city public transportation is worked out, basic conceptual approaches of research are defined among which are systematic approach, structural analysis, cartographical method and method of historical analysis, etc. The development of such model is preceded by identification of informational basis, data collection and collation in order to accumulate theoretical developments on this issue and the analysis of previous researchers’ works. Literary sources, cartographical sources, statistical and regulatory documents are studied. The third phase is analytical and statistical one which is devoted to the analysis of public transportation structure organization in the city of Kyiv. At this phase the greatest numbers of scientific research methods are used, namely, the structured system analysis method, analytical and statistical method, graph theory method in combination with the method of historical and geographical sectioning, factor analysis, cartographical, comparative geographical, societal geographical zoning methods.
