/strong></p><p>The paper is devoted to the definition of “speleocomplex” and its interpretation and place in natural karst caves. The limits of the territories on<br>the earth’s surface and deep in the bowels of the earth are substantiated. A proposed name for such spatial units is speleotopes. Taking into consideration that a lot of caves have a long length within one layer of karst rocks, complicated genesis, different morphology, and unique secondary sediments the author identified next types of speleotopes: morphological speleotopes – elementary surfaces of the topography of caves; litospeleotopes – areas homogeneous in secondary sediments; climatological speleotopes – galleries or their parts with homogeneous microclimate; phitospeleotopes – areas homogeneous in phitocenosis; zoospeleotopes – areas with regular concentration of troglophiles or with signs of their activities. The complex of the speleotopes can form speleochore.</p><p>Author focus attention on the self-restoration of the underground spatial subsystems and its speed. Karst landscapes on the surface have a<br>quicker energy exchange in comparison to underground landscapes. Therefore, the author argues that caves landscapes should have the higher<br>level of protection and reservation.</p><p>Main types of the use of the caves landscapes are described in the paper, among them mining, recreational, speleological and scientific. According to the level of changes author identified such types of speleological complexes: unchanged (natural) – speleological complexes of the<br>underground cavities that are unknown or untouched by human beings; slightly changed – anthropogenic activity is present but natural processes are unchanged; changed speleocomplexes (highly changed) – with a long-lasting anthropogenic footprint; transformed (cultural) – with a regular anthropogenic load and steadily degrading.</p><p>The necessity of the allotment of elementary spatial units in underground speleological karst subsystem is highlighted. Concepts and terminology for speleological complexes of natural karst cavities that experienced anthropogenic transformations are defined – anthropogenic<br>penetration and changes due to engineering. The paper also presents examples of anthropogenic speleological landscapes in Ukrainian caves. The author shows main directions for the optimization works (revitalization) of the transformed speleological complexes. Causes of the degradation of speleological complexes and ways of rational speleological management are also described.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>
