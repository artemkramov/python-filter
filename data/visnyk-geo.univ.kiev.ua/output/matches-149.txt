br></strong>The features of the thermal regime of dark-grey forest soils in Kyiv have been determined. The data of meteorological observations on the soil temperature of the United Hydrometeorological Station (UGMS) of Kiev for the period 1961-2013 were used in this investigation.</p><p>It was found that the lowest average monthly temperature of the soil surface is observed in January. The absolute minimum temperature is -36,0ºС. In the spring, the most intense rise in soil temperature occurs from March to April. In the summer, the average monthly temperature of the soil surface is highest (with a maximum in July) and is characterized by slight fluctuations from month to month. Absolute maximum temperature is 64,0ºС. In autumn, the reduction of temperature begins in August and during the season it is fairly even. The annual amplitude of the surface temperature of the soil in Kyiv is 30ºС (average value) and 100ºС (absolute value). The diurnal dynamics of the temperature of the soil surface is most clearly expressed in the warm period of the year: the temperature reaches maximum values at 15 hours; the minimum values are before the Sunrise. According to the analysis of the frost on the soil surface, the following features were established: the average date of termination of spring frost on the soil surface is May 3, the average date of the beginning of autumn frosts is October 2; the average freezing period in Kyiv is 151 days. There are traced clear typical regularities of soil temperature changes with depth in different seasons. The depth of penetration of the isotherm 0°С and the depth of freezing of the soil were also analyzed for the estimation of the thermal regime of the soil during the cold period of the year. It was found that they reach the maximum values at the end of February and are 80 cm and 62 cm respectively. The duration of stable freezing of the soil is about 100 days.
