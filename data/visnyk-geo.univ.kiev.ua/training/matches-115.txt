/strong></p><p>The results of calculating the total hydropower potential of Ukrainian Carpathians rivers were presented in the article. The total hydropower potential of specific sections of the rivers was calculated. The boundaries of the sections were identified by the changing characteristics of hydraulic channels.Calculation of the total hydropower potential of the rivers of the Carpathian region for Tisa, Siret, Prut and Dniester river basins, which have a length over 10 km were executed. There 334 rivers in the region were examined, 1,247 sections were identified. Total hydropower potential of Ukrainian Carpathians rivers are 2340531 kW or 2340,5&nbsp; MW. The volume potential annual capacity consists 20.5 billion KWh / year. The largest hydroelectric capacity is typical for the Tisza river basin (within Ukraine). Their total hydropower potential amounts 1092,4 MW, provides 46.4% all hydropower capacity of all Carpathian rivers of Ukraine. Hydroelectric power of Dniester river basin is 34,9% (321 MW) of the total general hydropower potential of the rivers of the Carpathian region of Ukraine. Part of the hydropower potential of the rivers of Prut river basin amounts 17,2% (404 MW) and of the Siret river basin amounts 1,01% (24 MW).</p><p>Total hydropower potential of the rivers of Ukrainian Carpathians&nbsp; proportionate to production capacity Dnipro hydropower cascade. In addition, total hydropower potential of rivers Ukrainian Carpathians exceeds economically effective hydropower potential of rivers in Ukraine to 3 bln. kWh / year, which is 17.5 billion. kWh / year.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>
