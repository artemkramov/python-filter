/strong></p><p>Using the example of the famous tourist route to the sources of the Chorna Tisa river, the possibility and necessity of use information about geological, geomorphological, hydrological and landscape features of the territory as tourist objects in order for popularize natural knowledge, are presented іn the work. A tourist route is proposed, which represented a combination of historical, cultural and natural information about the region. In the work focus is on natural objects that could interest tourists. As objects containing scientific cognitive natural information is invited to consider exits to the surface flysch complex, illustrating features of formation of the substance of the Carpathian Mountains, features of the transverse and longitudinal structure of valley of the mountain river, anthropogenic and natural-anthropogenic landforms and results their transformation over time, the consequences of exogenous processes. In addition, the document provides information on the features of the formation, distribution and changes of natural-territorial complexes, which can be seen on the route. The article mentions the floodplain, terraces, slopes and vertex natural complexes which are successively change during route. General data about typical plant communities in this region are presented. Attention is drawn to the character of typical economic use of natural systems and the consequences of inefficient use of nature in the region. The scheme of the route, showing points of observation are presented in the work. At these points can more fully to assess the natural features of the area and the changes which occur during typical use of nature in this region. The route is designed so that tourists can observe the typical floodplain geosystems covered hydromorphic plant communities and natural systems of low wetland terraces covered with vegetation typical of this bows, which are mainly used today as hay fields. Geosystems of slopes covered spruce forests, often drawing attention to themselves as a territory which is an example of unsustainable forest management. Some of these areas in the recent past were timber harvesting sites. In areas such apparent substitution of plant communities of Picea Abies prevailing in the area, the secondary shrub communities, forming dense thickets – so-called crimson logging. Polonyna Ripta Apshynetska is an area of felled forest, covered secondary associations of bows, which is using for traditional in the region transhumance grazing-type agriculture. At the end of the route in the upper part of mountain range Svydovets, a location is proposed, which is very successful, to explore the orographic structure of the Ukrainian Carpathians.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>
