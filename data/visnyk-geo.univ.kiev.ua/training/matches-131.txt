The research solves a series of new tasks that have a theoretical and methodological importance: interpretation the system of concepts forms the modern field of politico-geographical research TPS on different hierarchical levels and helps to build the scheme of systemic politico-geographical analysis. Practical implementation of the scheme systemic politico-geographical analysis will allow to fully studying problems of territorial and political organization of society, to carry out highly specialized research of individual elements of TPS or to analyze the territory in terms of a key (main) issue. Substantiated key positions for building the scheme of systemic politico-geographical analysis have to take into account modern challenges in society.</p><p>Methodology. Using the methods of system analysis and synthesis, inductive-deductive proof, abstraction and logical constructs provide the systemic research.
