/strong></p><p>The concept of stability appears when the system (natural, man-made) from one state to another, characterized by the ability to retain their specific properties over time and withstand external shocks without changing these properties, or to adjust to them. Sustainable development is not a change of state, and the creation and planning of such conditions (taking into account the impact of external factors), under which the system to reach the state of stability, is not passed to other states. It is therefore important to develop criteria indicate steady state of the system or not, whether the thresholds are met.</p><p>Note that the processing of the strategy concept of sustainable development can and apply a variety of indicators. To move from the analysis of sustainable development principles to action, there must be a system of specific qualitative and quantitative inter indicators – indicators that characterize the time variation of the economy, the environment and society at all levels of spatial-temporal and territorial organization.</p><p>For the last decade, “indicator thinking” has begun to widespread in the world. The necessity of tool evaluation of the on-going processes; giving their retrospective analysis and trying of future introspection help to form the corresponding indicators and quantity features. These tendencies are clearly reflected in the concept of long-life development. The indicators of long-life development should be used for different levels of government, authorities, wide public community as the so-called barometer of ecologic state of the world, countries and regions, processes and tendencies of their development. The article deals with the question of indications formation as a mandatory component of the long-life development.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>
