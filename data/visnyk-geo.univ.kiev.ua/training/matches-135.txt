/strong></p><p>The article is devoted to the application for cartographic image methods of objects, phenomena and processes on interactive maps – electronic dynamic cartographic models which are revolved exceptionally in a computer environment.</p><p>Existent knowledges are systematized in relation to the mapping methods, which are already used in the practice of electronic maps creation through the realized receptions in software of cartographic work automation. Such receptions are: intervals of values, linear geometrical figures, structural geometrical figures, graduated figures, density of points, separate values, “surface”.</p><p>The authors are carried out the improvement of existent comparison model of the computer mapping receptions, which are used in electronic maps (graphic copies as computer maps) with the cartographic image methods of the classic cartography (for static maps) with its bringing to the modern state, which are appeared through the newest realization of functional possibilities of the software proper groups.</p><p>It is indicated on the main feature of interactive maps, which consists of the possibility and use expedience for the cartographic reflection of mapping objects on the basis of static and dynamic graphic variables, which form indexes on certain mapping units by depicting facilities through the proper methods after the queries of user in a map session. It became the base of development the improved list of cartographic image methods for them. Determination of the specified name and maintenance of marks method is formulated, which can be used on interactive maps both after a point (corresponds to the classic understanding of method maintenance), and by linear units of mapping. That, it is a method of cartographic image, which helps to show the objects in points or on lines,&nbsp; and such that are usually not expressed in the scale of map with presentation of high-quality and/or quantitative features of objects, their underlying structure, and using of different depicting facilities (geometrical figures, letters of alphabet, constructions which remind the evident images of objects). Two method of marks modifications are offered: noncommunicative (static) and dynamic (movable).</p><p>Model which shows clear and synonymous co-operation of methods is developed for the correct use of all mapping receptions in interactive maps: classic with names clarifications or modifications; realized in the geographic information systems with the use of static graphic variables; involved in the multifunctional software (with dynamic graphic variables and multimedia effects).</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>
