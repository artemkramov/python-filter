/strong></p><p>This article discusses the structural organization of the mountainous part river Bystrica Nadvirnianska within the mountain of the Ukrainian Carpathians. We examine the need of such research. We highlights the methodology of research in GIS. We analyzed the main structural parameters of the river system. Determining the structure of river networks and their quantitative analysis is an important step in the research of the basin. Establishing patterns in the structure of the mountainous part basin river Bystrica Nadvirnianska is necessary step in geomorphological research. We found that in the mountainous part of the basin Bystrica Nadvirnianska, river network form the system in 1407 streams, including: 1083 streams of the 1st order, 253 – 2nd, 56 – 3rd, 12 – 4th, 2 – 5th, 1 – 6th order. The total stream length in the researched river basin 1112.1&nbsp;km, of which 603.7&nbsp;km is 1st order, 250.9&nbsp;km – 2nd, 110.8&nbsp;km – 3rd, 85.3&nbsp;km – 4th, 32,9&nbsp;km – 5th and 28.5&nbsp;km – the 6th order. The mean stream length of the 1st order of 0.56&nbsp;km, 2nd – 0.99&nbsp;km 3rd – 1.94&nbsp;km, 4th – 7.11&nbsp;km, 5th – 16.47&nbsp;km and 6th order 28.5&nbsp;km .Obtained data show that the smallest mean stream length characterized for the streams of the 1st of the 3rd, which are confined to the steep slopes of the mountain ranges. The sharp increase in the mean stream length is inherent for the flows 4th to 6th orders which flow within the longitudinal intermountain valleys. The stream length ratio can fix significant changes in river network caused by tectonic movements and structure of the territory, which influenced on the relief and the stream network. The stream length ratio of 2nd order is 1.77, 3rd – 1.96, 4th – 3.66, 5th – 2.31, 6th order – 1.73. The average bifurcation ratio in the researched basin 4.29, for the flows of the 1st order is 4.28, 2nd order – 4,44, 3rd – 4.75, 4th – 6 and 5th order – 2. In the researched basin drainage density is 1.78&nbsp;km/km<sup>2</sup>, of which 0.97&nbsp;km/km<sup>2</sup>accounted for streams of the 1st order and 0.046&nbsp;km/km<sup>2</sup>for streams of the 6th order. Average value of the stream frequency in the researched basin is 2.26 flows per km<sup>2</sup>, of which 1.74 falls on the streams of the first order and 0,002 on the 6th order.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>
