CONDITION OF LANDSCAPE EQUILIBRIUM UNDER DISTURBANGER
Characteristics of scale of landscape disturbances are of a special interest for the search for criteria and conditions of landscape equilibrium. Spatial, temporal and qualitative dimensions of a scale are of equal importance. The conditions of landscape equilibrium could be described using the ratio between the scale of disturbances and the scale of landscapes. The landscape equilibrium is in fact its shifting mosaic steady state. Besides the scale of disturbance the spatial disproportions in transformations of geochores at various stages of succession are important conditions for the landscape equilibrium. The application of theoretical considerations discussed is shown for the analysis of landscapes reaction to August 2007 forest fire in Lower Dnieper sand arena, Ukraine.
