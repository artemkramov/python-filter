Results of the analysis of natural and man-made threats indicate that the current state of environmental safety in most regions of Ukraine is almost at the required level. Particular attention is drawn to the objects of nuclear, chemical, metallurgy, mining, civil engineering, transportation systems. The negative influence of natural and technogenic safety on agriculture in Ukraine is shown as well. The main directions of environmental protection in agriculture are outlined. A need to provide a concrete and realistic plan to minimize the impact on the risks associated with natural and man-made hazards is identified.</p><p>Economic development and natural and man-made threats in the country at the present stage is characterized by dynamic changes and complex relationships that contribute to the formation of large risks in the environmental security of the state.
